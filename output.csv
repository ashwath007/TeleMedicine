0,Jarrad A. Merriman| MD| MPH,�Dr. Merriman is very nice and explained everything to me.�,5
1,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Total hip replacement: I can't believe how well my hip feels and has felt from almost immediately after surgery. I'm ready to do a well-deserved testimonial for Dr. Hernandez| SCOI| the surgical center at UCLA Health| and everyone else involved. The care| service| and results are the highest level possible. It's nice to walk| move and live without pain| thank you!�,5
2,Nickul S. Jain| MD,�Dr. Jain did surgery on my lower lumbar. I am thrilled with his care| and I feel that he is an excellent Dr. and surgeon. I had severe unexpected pain after surgery; he ordered tests to ensure that the surgery went well and as a precaution| called in his colleague| Dr. Schopler| to review criteria and examine me. Everything was good with the operation| and Dr. Jain ordered steroids to calm nerves down| and all went well from there.�,5
3,Nickul S. Jain| MD,�Indeed| the most treasured of the Doctors I have been privileged to meet. Dr. Jain treated me as if I was a family member during all my meetings with him| before Surgery| and after. The surgery was undoubtedly successful| and the results were as described. If he weren't specialized| I'd see him for everything!�,5
4,Nickul S. Jain| MD,�Dr. Jain was a kind| competent| and excellent diagnostician. He sent me to Dr. Blose. She is superior to check my neck| which none of the other orthopedic Doctors has done. I have a pinched nerve in my neck. Dr. Jain gave me hope when I had given up on getting relief from my back pain.�,5
5,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,"�Dr. Snyder was always very professional| thorough| and had an excellent ""bedside manner.""�",5
6,Harpreet S. Bawa| MD,�My experience was amazing. I felt that all the staff was very interested in my physical and mental comfort. Everything was well explained. I never was made to feel that caring for me was a burden. I had no reluctance to ask for what I needed. On top of that my medical outcome is great so far! I would recommend SCOI and Dr. Bawa to anyone who needs this procedure.�,5
7,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,"�The waiting room was comfortable| and I was ushered in about 20 minutes after arrival. Dr. Snyder is extremely knowledgeable| took the time to look at my MRI| and listened carefully to my injury history. He was very thoughtful about his opinion and did not offer ""pie in the sky"" possibilities for the outcome for my shoulder. I would come back to the institute again if I have future ortho needs. Dr. Snyder and his staff are great!�",5
8,Harpreet S. Bawa| MD,�Dr. Bawa is excellent. Dr. Bawa and his staff took care of all of the details and was always available to answer questions and help in any way. He cared about me as if I was his only patient. It is lovely not to have the pain. I am doing very well.�,5
9,Harpreet S. Bawa| MD,�Dr. Bawa is fantastic. I recommend him highly. When I had a post-op problem| he responded to my email with an immediate phone call! And it was on a Sunday! It is clear that Dr. Bawa cares for his patients and does everything possible for a positive outcome. His staff is warm and friendly| and what can I say; it was all good!�,5
10,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�Dr. Snyder is a fantastic person and a great doctor. He still has the compassion and concern for his patients that a lot of the young Doctors failed to learn. We went over the choices of surgeries for by Bicep tendon| and Dr. Snyder was able to make the repairs that I wanted.�,5
11,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�Dr. Snyder has operated on both my shoulders. I could not ask for a better experience either time.�,4
12,Harpreet S. Bawa| MD,�I love Dr. Bawa! He has genuine care and concern for his patients. Not only did he check on me during my stay in the hospital| but he also called me personally once I was released-- to make sure I was ok and to see if I had any questions. I'm so fortunate to have found such an excellent surgeon!�,5
13,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�Exactly one year ago today| in a random act of kindness. Someone reached out to me and offered me the use of this scooter. After 3 days of juggling food| drinks| and crutches from my kitchen back to my bed (usually catastrophically) my life was made much easier and getting around much safer. It wasn�t made out of carbon fiber| didn�t have aero wheels or aero handlebars| but it got me where I needed to be. God is good!!! I could actually wiggle my toes again and the pain level was gradually diminishing. My follow up appointment was in a few days| and I was looking forward to the healing process and eventually getting back in the saddle. A very special thank you to Margot Botello Shinn for her kindness and generosity. The longus tendon ruptured during the Race Across America in June 2018 and it took the insurance company two months to approve the tests and procedures to perform the necessary surgery to repair the damage. By that time| the tendon was garbage (surgeon's exact words) and was unsalvageable. Fortunately for me| I was referred to one of the best| if not the best foot and ankle specialist in the country. Dr. Ferkel was able to remove the damaged portion and attach the remaining length to the brevus tendon| clean out all the scar tissue| and tidy up and stabilize the entire joint. Prior to surgery| he asked me what my postsurgical goals were. I told him in no uncertain terms that I had some races to win| and one or two more records to set. He just looked at me and grinned and then walked out the door. Then he stopped| turned around and said to me| �let�s make it three.� I knew that I was in the right hands!!! My surgery was on August 29th| 2018. On August 25th| 2019 (361 days after that operation) my team set a new record for the HooDoo 500. One down| two to go!!! To Dr. Richard Ferkel| the miracle that you performed for me| will forever be a reminder of the hours and the meticulous detail and effort that you gave to me and all your patients. God Bless�,5
14,Nickul S. Jain| MD,�Dr. Jain was extremely thorough with diagnosing our son�s football injury. Although the outcome wasn�t what we wanted to hear he was truthful and blunt about treatment. We appreciate his kindness| concern| and care he showed our son.�,5
15,Nickul S. Jain| MD,�Very satisfied and feel like I am in good hands.�,5
16,Karl R. Balch| MD,�Positive overall with partial knee now at eight week�s post-op. Got through physical therapy. Have better balance with neurological problems because knee swelling reduced the healing effect of living. With the swelling cut| good things may happen. Life is good| thanks| Dr. Balch.�,5
17,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I met with Dr. Hernandez a year and a half later to discuss knee replacement and when I mentioned my left hip was hurting| he immediately did an x-ray and it turns out I needed a hip replacement as well. We decided together that the hip replacement should be done before the knee replacement. I am looking forward to having Dr. Hernandez as my surgeon. Highly recommended by patients and doctors.�,4
18,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�All of SCOI�s staff and doctors have shown me such professionalism thought my appts and surgery. I mainly felt that the pre-op appt and day-surgery were very informative. Nurses and Doctors we�re kind and explained what was happening every step of the way.�,5
19,Karl R. Balch| MD,�This has been the most comfortable surgery I've ever had| not that I've had many| but just saying. The doctor and staff have been great| and there have been no surprises| which I like. All in all| I would recommend SCOI| Dr. Balch| and hip replacement surgery to anyone who is contemplating doing it.�,5
20,Karl R. Balch| MD,�Our experience with Dr. Balch was fantastic! He has an excellent bedside manner. Before the day of surgery| Dr. Balch told us everything that would happen. Surgery went just as he said it would and the timeline was within 5 minutes of how long the procedure would take. Dr. Balch made us feel entirely at ease with the entire process. He answered every question entirely| and in terms we understood.�,5
21,Karl R. Balch| MD,�The nurse and Dr. Balch are very kind.�,5
22,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�The anterior hip replacement went very smoothly. Everything explained| and follow-up was consistent so that the procedure was successful.�,5
23,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�At my initial appointment consultation| I met with my surgeon Doctor Jaime Hernandez. Doctor Hernandez listened attentively| addresses and answered all my questions and concerns thoroughly. I knew I had met with the surgeon that would provide with not all only the best options for my particular situation. More importantly| he presented me with such clarity and made my decision to have him perform my right knee replacement surgery.�,4
24,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I am delighted with my experience. Every single person on your staff was terrific| and the system worked flawlessly. I was tended to and kept comfortable at all times. Thank you!�,5
25,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�In November| I had my second hip replacement procedure by Dr. Hernandez. The care I received before the surgery and after the operation was excellent. All the attention that I received from Dr. Hernandez and staff was excellent.�,5
26,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Very happy with your prompt and efficient service.�,5
27,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Dr. Hernandez is the best! Love this man; he gave me back my life| he and his staff are so professional and organized everything went like clockwork. I recommend Dr. Hernandez all the time!�,5
28,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Great Doctor and staff| care were five stars before and after surgery! Results of the operation were better than I expected! My mobility is back| and I do not have to use a cane to get around! I will refer Doctor Hernandez & SCOI to my friends and family for their orthopedic needs! Could not be happier with my results! Thank you to the Doctor & Staff!�,1
29,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I have no complaints about the care I received from Dr. Hernandez. I found him informative| professional and overall very much a patient advocate. My overall perioperative experience has been excellent.�,5
30,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Professional| knowledgeable| talented and skilled.�,5
31,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Dr. Hernandez has a fantastic attitude| both humorous and caring. His straightforward honesty was a breath of fresh air| he told me what I needed what to expect and did it all with humor a great skill. I don�t look forward to surgery but when it�s time for my left knee I will be returning to Dr. Hernandez and the fantastic staff at SCOI.�,5
32,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Dr. Hernandez is an excellent doctor who knows exactly what he is doing and knows what his patients need each time. His division of labor and collaboration among his colleagues and medical personnel is worthy of emulation. I admire his courage| empathy and hard work.�,5
33,John L. Etcheverry| DPM,�I am a patient of Dr. Etcheverry. I have been a law enforcement supervisor and adminstrator for many years. I have been responsible for the hiring| terminating| evaluating and training staff that were non-sworn| such as records| dispatch| and community service officers. I am not in the habit of giving empty compliments where they are not earned. I would like to give you and the staff of Dr. Etcheverry's office my heartfelt compliments on their job performance. Everyone I spoke with smiled| and was attentive. When I was having a conversation with anyone in the office or surgery center each person made eye contact with me. Our conversations were articulate and intelligent leaving me completely knowledgeable and satisfied that my needs were taken care of. What a pleasure to talk with someone without a cell phone in their hand or otherwise distracted. I recognize professionalism when I see it. I requested a form to be completed and Anna told me she would have it done in a half hour and sent. For a moment| I thought I passed out and was hallucinating. Unfortunately| I can not remember all of the staff members names| especially those in the new office. Please extend my thanks and compliments to all!�,5
34,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�Dr. Snyder was great.�,5
35,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Dr. Hernandez was a super surgeon and the hospital staff were great| comforting| and always there for me. I had a complete knee replacement. Now| months out| I�m doing better.�,5
36,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�Dr. Snyder is excellent. No complaints at all.�,4
37,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I just want Dr Carlos Guanche to know that on Sunday Feb 25| I completed a 102 mile bicycle ride from Santa Ana to San Diego| exactly 179 days after he performed total hip replacement on me. Thanks from this 64 year old man for giving me my life back.�,5
38,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�I am a retired camera-woman for the news. I worked at KABC channel 7 for 38 years. My job was basically that of a football player without the protective gear. I am writing this letter to share my wonderful experience at SCOI| Southern California Orthopedic Institute| namely| Dr. Richard Ferkel and Natalie Ray. I injured my left shoulder in 2004 in 2013 and again in 2015 at work. In 2004| I was pushed by a camera person from a French company while covering Arnold Schwarzenegger and then Governor| Gray Davis. When covering a campaign| the normal drill is that you run ahead of the candidate| stop shoot them| let them get in front of you and run again to catch up to them to shoot them coming towards the camera. While running| a French still photographer pushed me out of the way| I had a 35 pound camera on my shoulder; I went crashing into the sidewalk and hit the concrete with my left shoulder and gashed my right knee. I went to the Kerlin-Jobe clinic. Because of their reputation| I thought I would be getting the best medical help for my shoulder and knee available. This proved not to be the case. I was told by the physician that attended me that my only option was to have surgery. I was also told that they would prefer not to deal with Workmen�s Comp. Since I got hurt on the job it did not make sense not to be covered by Workmen�s Comp. I was trying to get my 40 years of work in with the company so I went back to work| no surgery nor competent physical therapy. In the year 2013 I damaged my left shoulder again while shooting the flight of the NASA shuttle to Los Angeles. The crowd was very rowdy and pushed me in such a way that the camera| which was on a tripod| jammed into my shoulder. I had to find an orthopedic doctor again. I was lost as to what direction to take in picking a doctor. My husband�s best friend| Jim Knutsen has a sister who had been treated by Dr. Ferkel. Since I trusted Jim| I trusted the glowing recommendation from his sister Janet. She said Dr. Ferkel was the best orthopedic doctor she had ever come across� She was right! I was blessed to find Dr. Ferkel. I went to SCOI In 2013. Doctor Ferkel was very thorough and went through all my options. I elected to get a treatment of physical therapy and a series of shots that helped my arm heal. I was still trying to get my 40 years in| with the help of Dr. Ferkel| I was able to get a few more years in. In 2015 I had a very bad fall from the side of my truck when my mini-cam truck caught fire. It was a traumatic fall that injured my right shoulder| and re-injured my left shoulder| my right ankle and my back. The injuries I sustained resulted in two torn rotator cuff�s & other miscellaneous injuries in the shoulders. I basically had two shoulder reconstructions. Dr. Ferkel has not only been thorough but kind and extremely patient with my care. I was still trying to get my 40 years in. Unfortunately| Workmen�s Comp. delayed delayed and delayed authorization for my treatments and my company was forced to terminate my position because I had �timed out�. I had been an excellent National Emmy award winning camera person and a valued employee at KABC. Workmen�s Comp. has not been professional but the doctor has hung in there with me and has gotten me the care that I needed. About a year and a half ago| my case manager for Workmen�s Comp. wrote a scathing letter to the Insurance company that covers my care. What she did was commit fraud because she used my name and made it sound like it was from me. I would never have written such a letter because none of what she wrote was true. This is what I have been subjected to with Workmen�s Comp. I wanted to get back to work but the Workmen�s Comp. people made it impossible by delaying authorizations for my care. Through all this... Dr. Ferkel & Natalie Ray stood by me and made sure I received the medical care| physical therapy and appointments that I have needed. My medical needs were first and foremost to Dr. Ferkel and to Natalie. After both surgeries| I needed a �cooling machine� for my shoulders. Doctor Ferkel made sure I got it and that it was delivered to my home. Workmen�s Comp. did not want to authorize this piece of equipment. I want to say that it was the one piece of equipment that took me through the process. I was in severe pain and I would have required more pain medication had I not had the �cooling machine�. I don�t know it�s technical name but I call it a lifesaver. Natalie Ray has been a tremendous part of my recovery. Natalie was indispensable to me through this process. Natalie has been kind| patient| knowledgeable and helpful. I could write three pages alone on Natalie. She is the most professional and hard-working medical professional I have ever seen. Natalie is truly a �feather� in SCOI�s hat. Again| let me finish by saying that this has been the most difficult time of my entire life. Never did I think I would have to endure such painful injuries. Dr. Ferkel has given me new hope and life. I thank God for SCOI but especially for Dr. Ferkel. I would and do recommend Dr. Ferkel to anybody who needs shoulder or feet/ankle medical care. I have already recommended the doctor to a few of my friends. I have many friends that are camera people and as it turns out| there are a lot of shoulder injuries out there� God bless Dr. Ferkel| thank you for your incredible effort and care of my shoulders and ankle.�,1
39,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�Dr. Karzel and stall were beyond my expectations. Everyone was helpful and professional. Dr. Karzel is an awesome surgeon| with a winning bedside manner. My recovery has been amazing! I would gladly recommend tge doctor|along with his staff| to anyone.�,4
40,Richard J. Spelts| DO| FAAFP,�He always listens to what I have to say & will answer my questions in a way I can understand. Very caring - always tell my friends about my awesome Doctor.�,5
41,Jared A. Niska| MD,�I had a great service with Dr. Niska he did surgery for both of my hands for Carpal Tunnel. I have no more numbness and sleep much better now. He is a very friendly Doctor.�,5
42,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,"�Dr. Hernandez performed surgery to replace my left hip. At about 2:00 that very same afternoon I left Northridge Hospital with the notion of most likely having to stay bed-ridden for several days so as to recover from the procedure but thanks to the Dr. Hernandez's ""magic touch"" I was not only ambulatory the next day but was able to drive myself to my office to conduct a full day's business and have not missed a day since the surgery. Even better| I only missed four days of walking my dog Kiba on his regular route and pace. What more could I have asked?!�",3
43,David K. Wahba| MD,�Great doctor| honest and direct.�,3
44,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I have been having trouble with my shoulder| lots of pain when doing certain activities. I workout regularly and try to stay as fit as possible. Dr. Bahk has been very good at explaining what was going on in my shoulder and has given me realistic expectations. He ordered an MRI to be done on my shoulder and found that I have arthritis so he advised that I get a cortisone shot| which I did. I have had a great outcome| very little pain and mobility is excellent. Thanks| Doc.�,4
45,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I went to SCOI because their previous care for my family and me was exceptional. My right hip arthroplasty further exemplifies those previous experiences. During the entire procedure from diagnosis and options through post-operation treatment and counseling| Dr. Hernandez and his support staff were exceptional and focused on my case. Dr. Hernandez| the entire SCOI staff that I enter acted with and the Northridge Hospital staff were superior| in my estimation| because simply they cared for me and my outcome from the procedure. I can honestly say that I have felt NO pain throughout the procedure. I did have some sore muscles| but no pain. My only regret is that I did not have it done sooner.�,5
46,Fadi S. Saied| DO ,�I had a full left knee replacement with Dr. Saied. He and his staff were wonderful especially Maria. I am 100% satisfied with my procedure it has been two weeks ago today and I would recommend anyone with knee problems to see Dr. Saied and his staff. Thank you.�,5
47,Trevor P. Lynch| MD| FACS,�I'm so pleased that I could find the SCOI practice near my home in Santa Clarita. I've been a patient for 20 years with Santa Monica Orthopedic due to my prior residency in West LA. After having moved to SCV| I was driving to Santa Monica (when necessary) for follow-up appointments with my surgeon. Being able to eliminate the grueling drive to the west side is priceless. The SCOI office seems to run very efficiently and the staff are friendly and professional. Dr. Lynch has been both reassuring and realistic about the recovery from my broken wrist in late December (I was fortunate not to require surgery) and I would not hesitate to seek his services for any future health matters that fall under his specialty. And| Arielle (on the physical therapy staff) is fantastic. She listened to my concerns about being able to play guitar again and when I saw her for my next session| she had done specific research on the muscles| tendons and ligaments used to make a barre chord and had a targeted exercise to help me regain strength in my thumb and index finger. She's a true professional. Overall| I would recommend to anyone that lives in SCV requiring orthopedic experts not to hesitate to seek out the services of the Southern California Orthopedic Institute.�,5
48,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Dr. Hernandez is the best| I recommend him highly to everyone I speak with. His professionalism| knowledge and precise approach to both of the surgeries he performed on me were greatly appreciated. I knew every step of the way what to expect before| during and after the surgery. Having both hips replaced with in a 3 month period his expertise has given me back my active life again. His staff and surgical staff are absolutely wonderful| I felt like my hand was held before and through out the surgeries| physical therapy and finally when I was released to enjoy life again. LOVE this man and his staff! and again I would highly recommend him and have to anyone in need of his services. I am a happy| active 65 year old woman with a spring in my step once again because of Dr. Hernandez :)�,5
49,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�Dr. Karzel fixed a shoulder issue that other orthopedic doctors failed to do. They have become very special in my life and my world. I have returned to my very active life with my new start. Extremely recommended in every way... and Mickey is fun and a bright ray of sunshine in my heart as they all do.�,5
50,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�Dr. Getelman was kind and direct when treating me for a torn ACL and torn meniscus. He told me surgery was the only option and explained why| walked me through what he would do| and a few days later he was true to his word. I was told my surgery took extra time because of the extensive damage to my knee| but I would never have known it because Dr. Getelman and his staff were so helpful and professional. I truly felt like I was in trustworthy and exceptional hands. After surgery with Dr. Getelman I was referred to Physical Therapist Dominic Smith at SCOI. Dominic�s team is incredible and I couldn�t recommend a better group of people to help you mentally and physically recover from surgery. The recovery was rough| but Team Smith provided positive reinforcement and small goals that guided you to long term success. I am extremely thankful for the care and support SCOI provided me.�,1
51,Todd D. Moldawer| MD,�Yesterday I was released by Dr. Moldawer. He performed a three (3) hour spine surgery on me in your hospital. He was the best ... and your administrative staff| health care providers| and support personnel could not have been better. Thank you.�,5
52,Todd Shapiro| MD,�The wait was short and I didn't have any issues.�,5
53,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�I really want to thank Dr. Ferkel (and Crew) for all for the amazing & wonderful care you provided me. Within a year| you have fixed my knee| foot & shoulder and I am back to a very full work schedule| very demanding & physical| which I could not possibly have sustained & continued without your precision care. I know that I am not special or unique| and that you give everyone| of which there are so many| the same degree of effort & concern. It is quite an operation you all keep up. I just want you to know how much you are appreciated| and how very much you bring to the community. We are very fortunate to have you! From the front desk to the cast room & check out| I hope you all know it really matters and makes a difference that you are able to do such a high volume with such a great level of recovery and success| all the while making all your patients feel important and maintaining such a positive environment in a tough arena where people are suffering and in need of serious help. I cannot thank you enough but hope you all know what a difference and impact you make on people�s lives. THANK YOU�..�,5
54,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�It is with my deepest gratitude that I am writing this. Today| I thoroughly enjoyed myself| working up a good sweat in a Latin dance class. Monday| I worked out with 80 other folks during a 2 hour| Pierce College| Encore class entitled Body Movement. This is the stuff that makes me so very happy| and I wouldn�t be participating in such activities at age 64 if it wasn�t for your knowledge| surgical skill| and human compassion| which you applied as you repaired my damaged left knee�s meniscus in March 2012. Last Year| 2011 Thanksgiving holiday| I knew I injured my knee and lower leg| as I was hiking up in the Cascade Wilderness. By the time I arrived home in Los Angeles| I could barely walk. Having knee support for a few weeks afterward still did nothing to heal my leg| and that�s when I made an appointment with you. Your diagnosis and subsequent meniscus surgery| dramatically improved my quality of life! Before I knew it| on March 1st| I was comfortably in and out of the surgical center within a few hours. From there| following your post-surgical directions| my recuperation went extremely smooth. I truly appreciate the follow up check ups and the time and patience you applied to promote healing as well as answer all of my questions. The prescription for two months of therapy with Nathan and Brian made my recovery even stronger and faster. I learned the proper way to use my body to avoid injury| as well as various exercises to strengthen my leg muscle and core. I still do these at home! This entire experience left me with a feeling of complete respect| gratefulness| and admiration for everyone involved in my healing process. I realize though that the process could never begun without your excellent surgical abilities| concern| confidence| and care! I hope you never change Dr. Bahk. I know how hard you work and how much you travel| yet you are always so positive| knowledgeable| friendly| and confident! Thank you so much for helping me get back to my normal!�,5
55,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�Thanks for showing us that there are doctors in this world that are willing to go above and beyond. Most doctors are in such a hurry that they barely catch your name. Thankfully| that�s not you! We are incredibly thankful for your careful attention to any and every detail regarding my care. We think you rock and you�re truly a class act doctor!�,1
56,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I wanted to thank you for your knowledge| skill| and expertise as a fabulous surgeon| gifted in the orthopedic field. Thanks to your work and help with my shoulder. The terrible 24/7 pain has been essentially relieved. I cannot relate to you how deeply grateful I am for all you have given back to me! I also appreciate greatly your caring personality in today�s world of medicine. Thank you for making my life easier.�,5
57,Todd D. Moldawer| MD,�I celebrated a birthday a couple of months ago. I am now the ripe age of 80. And my spine still works as well as when you operated on me back in 1988. I do a light workout at a nearby gym three to four days a week| which I�m sure helps my back remain supple and firm in the right places. Last week| I signed up with a trainer to devise a regimen that would help me stay in good shape over the next twenty years or so. The trainer made the statement to me that virtually; all back problems are caused by bad posture. It was than I thought of you and your marvelously executed surgery. I thank you once again.�,5
58,Babak Barcohana| MD,�In April 2011| Amazing first and new technique used for cervical spine fusion. Tantalum implant with amazing results are the best words to describe my surgery. After six months of non-stop tingling and pin sensations in my left arm| it was great to return to a normal life. I tried acupuncture| anti-inflammatory prescriptions| physical therapy| traction| and second opinions from doctors. Dr. Barcohana�s reputation speaks highly for itself amongst physical therapists| nurses| and other orthopedic doctors| who referred you. The ability to walk immediately after surgery and not be bedridden was important with type two diabetes. I am most grateful for the instant results handled by using ice| bone growth stimulator| and a few Tylenol for discomfort or soreness but no major pain. It is a pleasure to have the quality of care and a doctor that thinks outside of the box| to new minimal invasive medical techniques for less pain and quicker healing. Such a great doctor and surgical team that gave me 110% confidence to do the surgery and caring staff to assist me!�,5
59,David M. Auerbach| MD,�Dr. Auerbach is the most excellent physician I have been to. He listened and prescribed the perfect prescription! He is a miracle worker!�,5
60,Babak Barcohana| MD,�This acknowledges how happy I am with the results of the back surgery performed by Dr. Barcohana. Having back surgery involves a time period that begins with a prognosis| which is determined by x-rays and a MRI| along with your analysis. You spend a lot of time with your doctor prior| during| and after the surgery. The confidence that I have in him as both a doctor and a person is more than I have ever had with the many doctors I have seen in my life. His gentle approach to explaining every step made me feel extremely confident and unafraid of the surgery I was going to have. He was right on with how I would feel| along with his prediction of the steps to my recovery. I wake up every morning feeling like I had a back transplant| as my life is getting back to the way I felt prior to my long term back problems. Thank you very much for giving me the quality of life that I had prior to my back problems.�,5
61,Babak Barcohana| MD,�Dr. Barcohana performed surgery on me last month. It was a double discectomy and double fusion and I�m very pleased with the results. I had severe back pain for five years and I want to tell others who are suffering in pain| to not be afraid. You really are in good hands with Dr. Barcohana. I put my fear on hold| having a choice of being in severe pain for the rest of my life or taking a positive chance with a good doctor. I was already in constant pain. So for me| there was nothing to lose. I greatly helped myself by keeping my weight down| walking my dogs daily| taking weight-training classes| and yoga. Even though I hurt all the time| I kept on walking. Although I was in good shape before the operation| it wouldn�t have been successful without my very gifted surgeon| Dr. Barcohana. I highly recommend him. �,5
62,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�Just wanted to let you know how great my knee is doing. I came in January of 2008 with a torn meniscus. I bump skied this year. Thank you again! �,5
63,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I want to express my appreciation for the expertise and care I received from Dr. Babak Barcohana and his staff. I also want to applaud the SCOI facility and organization for the attention I received while preparing and undergoing back surgery| which was on 3/28/11. From the initial consultation| the surgery itself| the aftercare| was all first rate. As all would agree| communication during a time of surgery| especially the obvious fears involved with spinal surgery| this is extremely necessary and important to the patient. Dr. Barcohana and his excellent staff are second to none. In case I forgot to mention| the extreme pain and discomfort I had prior to the surgery is gone. After all| that is what it�s all about! Thanks again| Dr. Barcohana and staff.�,5
64,Todd D. Moldawer| MD,�I wanted to take a minute to say thank you for helping me get my life back by sending me to your wonderful physical therapy department. I have been seeing Brian and Phil. With Brian�s supervision| Phil has spent time helping me relieve my pain and showing me how to strengthen and care for my back. I have no pain and I am slowly going back to my activities. My sincere thanks and compliments to you on employing such competent| friendly| and caring staff. �,5
65,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I wanted to thank you for your knowledge| skill| and expertise as a fabulous surgeon| gifted in the orthopedic field. Thanks to your work and help with my shoulder. The terrible 24/7 pain has been essentially relieved. I cannot relate to you how deeply grateful I am for all you have given back to me! I also appreciate greatly your caring personality in today�s world of medicine. Thank you for making my life easier.�,5
66,Todd D. Moldawer| MD,�I celebrated a birthday a couple of months ago. I am now the ripe age of 80. And my spine still works as well as when you operated on me back in 1988. I do a light workout at a nearby gym three to four days a week| which I�m sure helps my back remain supple and firm in the right places. Last week| I signed up with a trainer to devise a regimen that would help me stay in good shape over the next twenty years or so. The trainer made the statement to me that virtually; all back problems are caused by bad posture. It was than I thought of you and your marvelously executed surgery. I thank you once again.�,5
67,Babak Barcohana| MD,�In April 2011| Amazing first and new technique used for cervical spine fusion. Tantalum implant with amazing results are the best words to describe my surgery. After six months of non-stop tingling and pin sensations in my left arm| it was great to return to a normal life. I tried acupuncture| anti-inflammatory prescriptions| physical therapy| traction| and second opinions from doctors. Dr. Barcohana�s reputation speaks highly for itself amongst physical therapists| nurses| and other orthopedic doctors| who referred you. The ability to walk immediately after surgery and not be bedridden was important with type two diabetes. I am most grateful for the instant results handled by using ice| bone growth stimulator| and a few Tylenol for discomfort or soreness but no major pain. It is a pleasure to have the quality of care and a doctor that thinks outside of the box| to new minimal invasive medical techniques for less pain and quicker healing. Such a great doctor and surgical team that gave me 110% confidence to do the surgery and caring staff to assist me!�,5
68,David M. Auerbach| MD,�Dr. Auerbach is the most excellent physician I have been to. He listened and prescribed the perfect prescription! He is a miracle worker!�,4
69,Babak Barcohana| MD,�This acknowledges how happy I am with the results of the back surgery performed by Dr. Barcohana. Having back surgery involves a time period that begins with a prognosis| which is determined by x-rays and a MRI| along with your analysis. You spend a lot of time with your doctor prior| during| and after the surgery. The confidence that I have in him as both a doctor and a person is more than I have ever had with the many doctors I have seen in my life. His gentle approach to explaining every step made me feel extremely confident and unafraid of the surgery I was going to have. He was right on with how I would feel| along with his prediction of the steps to my recovery. I wake up every morning feeling like I had a back transplant| as my life is getting back to the way I felt prior to my long term back problems. Thank you very much for giving me the quality of life that I had prior to my back problems.�,5
70,Babak Barcohana| MD,�Dr. Barcohana performed surgery on me last month. It was a double discectomy and double fusion and I�m very pleased with the results. I had severe back pain for five years and I want to tell others who are suffering in pain| to not be afraid. You really are in good hands with Dr. Barcohana. I put my fear on hold| having a choice of being in severe pain for the rest of my life or taking a positive chance with a good doctor. I was already in constant pain. So for me| there was nothing to lose. I greatly helped myself by keeping my weight down| walking my dogs daily| taking weight-training classes| and yoga. Even though I hurt all the time| I kept on walking. Although I was in good shape before the operation| it wouldn�t have been successful without my very gifted surgeon| Dr. Barcohana. I highly recommend him. �,5

73,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I want to express my gratitude to the extraordinary surgery that was performed on my back| which was a lumbar fusion. For thirty years| I had tried different procedures| medications| and other doctors. Still| I was enduring severe pain| especially on my right leg. Today| only after two months since my surgery| I am very pleased with the results. The pain on my right leg has subsided. It feels like a miracle! My experience has been extremely positive. I credit this to the great effort and expertise of Dr. Barcohana and his entire surgical team. This procedure has given me the ability to continue to maintain a healthier lifestyle. The result of my recent surgery is beyond my expectations. For any future patients that are experiencing decisions about this procedure| I wholeheartedly recommend it. �,5
74,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I would like to say that Dr. Barcohana referred me to Southern California Orthopedic Institute. The service and care they have provided is outstanding| from the staff�s politeness to the professional environment| in which they care for their patients. On a scale from 1 through 10| I would give it a huge 10! Thank you! �,5
75,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I first inquired about surgery in 1998 with local surgeons| and it just seemed as if they were all too eager to schedule surgery without exploring other options. I was wary of surgery| wary of spending any time in the hospital| so finding SCOI more than a dozen years ago was a godsend. It was my choice to avoid surgery for as long as possible. The treatment I received at SCOI helped me do just that. When the time for a surgical fix arrived| having a doctor who exhibited confidence and that he could provide a remedy to my pain with a minimum of invasiveness made my decision to proceed so much easier. Now| fifteen weeks out| with physical therapy complete and no pain what so ever| I feel years younger. I look forward to getting up in the morning and taking on the demands of the day. I want to say thank you for all of your skill| help| and guidance through this process. You gave me my life back| and I am forever grateful for that. Again| much thanks and appreciation.�,5
76,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I would like to tell you how pleased I am with my low back surgery| which was eight weeks ago. When I came fully awake in my room on August 2nd| I realized I didn�t have pain down my leg! This was the first time since my original injury in January that I didn�t have pain going down my leg. When I originally injured my lower back| I thought it was a pulled muscle or back strain. The doctor and I gave it the three to four weeks of recovery and therapy. That is the normal treatment plan but I didn�t respond as normal. When I reinjured my back in May| the doctor put me off work until I had my consultation. At the initial consultation| Dr. Barcohana�s desire to give me the best results for my situation made me feel that I was looked at as a complete person with my future functionally in mind. At that point| both my husband and I knew that the decision to go to SCOI and see Dr. Barcohana was the right one. As I said above| from the time I awoke from surgery| I have NEVER again had pain down my left leg. Since my injury eight months before| I had never been out of pain! I didn�t realize how debilitating it had become as I had continued to function and ignored the pain as much as I could. I know that pills were not the answer and avoided them as much as possible. When I came home August 5th and finally started to move around| I would freeze and wait for the pain and it didn�t come! That�s when I really realized how wonderful it felt. Thank you for making me whole again and giving back the ability to work and function again. �,5
77,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I am a 74-year-old white female in good health. I am 5�2 and I weigh 114 pounds. I have always led a very active life| including exercising| walking| dancing. In 2009| I began to experience pain in the lower left side of my back. A physician told me I could avoid surgery through physical therapy. I was in physical therapy for about one year. During that year| I also had thirteen injections to relieve the pain. There was no relief. In fact| the pain began to increase. Finally in 2011| I consulted Dr. Barcohana. After taking x-rays| I was diagnosed with spinal stenosis. I was still apprehensive about surgery. But after Dr. Barcohana explained the procedure and the positive results I could expect| I agreed. My surgery was performed October 22| 2011. I was hospitalized for three days. Since pain medication doesn�t agree with me| upon arriving home| I just took extra strength Tylenol as needed. The pain was minimal. Dr. Barcohana recommended physical therapy for approximately three months| first| aquatic| then the gym. On January 12| 2012| I was allowed to remove my back brace. My last day of therapy was February 6| 2012. I now have no pain and I am starting to get back to my normal routine. The only regret I have is the fact that I waited so long to have the surgery. I am very grateful to Dr. Barcohana for a job well done. �,5
78,Babak Barcohana| MD,�After years of severe pain| much of it going down my leg| I sought out an expert for help. More than one physician referred me to Dr. Barcohana. I am ecstatic that I followed their recommendations! After consulting with Dr. Barcohana and his supportive staff| a date for surgery was set. The operation was very successful and I am totally pain free| just as Dr. Barcohana had predicted. His skills enabled me to declare myself able to resume everyday activities| as well as returning to sports. I am now retired and love to work at acting. Dr. Barcohana is well aware of my desires and thanks to him| auditions and performing are once again| all possible! THANK YOU!�,5
79,Babak Barcohana| MD,�It is my pleasure to recommend the services of Dr. Babak Barcohana and his staff. He is a caring physician as well as a skilled one. Every aspect of my spinal surgery was positive and my recovery has been phenomenal. Dr. Blecher| another physician at Southern California Orthopedic Institute| referred me to Dr. Barcohana in April 2010. A recent MRI had shown that I had a broken cervical disc| with a piece pressing on the nerve. I was in extreme pain and quickly losing control of my right arm. From the moment Dr. Barcohana entered the examining room he was attentive. He listened to all my complaints and performed a complete exam. He explained every recommendation he made. He took the time to record my complete case into the computer. He answered all of my questions. I felt positive that spinal surgery was my best option towards relieving my pain as well as regaining control of my arm. Surgery was scheduled quickly with the help of Dr. Barcohana�s knowledgeable and competent staff. However| Dr. Barcohana went one step further. I have a history of metal allergy. When I expressed my concerns to Dr. Barcohana| he called the prosthetic disc supplier and arranged to have a disc delivered the next day. He taped this to my arm to perform a simple skin test to check for any allergies. I had no reaction. Dr. Barcohana performed my surgery May 4| 2010. Check �in was simple and quick. The nurses are compassionate and friendly. Surgery began at 7 a.m. and I was awake in my room before 2 p.m. My throat was sore| but the pain in my neck was completely gone. The surgery was a success and I have not had any pain since. The hospital staff had me up and walking within an hour after I awoke. The physical therapists are very helpful in preparing you for a successful recovery. I was released the next day and my sore throat was gone within a couple of days. I took the therapist�s advice and walked as much as possible after surgery. I believe that the increased circulation aided my speedy recovery. I was in cervical collar for a few weeks and couldn�t lift anything heavier than 5 pounds for a few months. However| I followed Dr. Barcohana�s directions precisely| for fear of compromising his excellent work. I returned to SCOI for my 1-year anniversary check-up. X-rays show that I have healed completely. I have no pain or restriction of movement. I feel fantastic! I am very grateful to Dr. Barcohana. I recommend this surgery to anyone considering it. It was such a great experience and no difficulty at all. Ask Dr. Barcohana your questions. He is exceedingly knowledgeable and patient. I am confident in his abilities.�,4

84,Babak Barcohana| MD,�When I met Dr. Barcohana| I was unable to do anything but lay in bed. The pain I experienced was so intense that while I was on pain medication| muscle relaxants| and ibuprofen| I was still in constant excruciating pain. The pain from my back went down my left leg| making it very difficult for me to walk or stand. Sitting was impossible. I ate my meals| lying on my side| having to use a straw for drinks. Dr. Barcohana recommended surgery. The morning following surgery| I was sitting up in bed and walking. I went home that day and was able to walk up the stairs of my home. I stopped all pain medication two days after surgery. The pain I have now is subsiding and I am able to mover better every day. I would highly recommend having back surgery by Dr. Barcohana to anyone with back pain. My only regret is that I didn�t get to his office sooner. �,5
85,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I am writing to thank you for allowing me the pleasure of walking again| after living with intense pain for four years. Having been advised by another spinal specialist that I might be better off learning to live with the pain| because the risks associated with surgery might outweigh the benefit due to the number of things that were involved in my case| your optimism gave me the confidence to undergo the fusion process. Now| three weeks after surgery| I can walk with a spring in my step and sit up for a few hours each day. As my healing progresses| I look forward to reclaiming my life. Thank you so much.�,5
86,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I was suffering from acute sciatica. Every day| sharp| stabbing pain was shooting down my right leg. I went to Dr. Barcohana| who determined I had a disc shard wedged into my sciatic nerve root and that I would need a surgical procedure to remove it. I freaked. I�d never had a surgery before| and every worse case scenarios ran through my mind. What if it doesn�t work? What if I end up paralyzed? You name it I thought it. But the surgery was a breeze. The moment I woke up in recovery| the sciatic pain was gone. I woke up in recovery at 9 p.m. on a Tuesday and was home by 1 p.m. Wednesday. Dr. Barcohana did a fantastic job and I have to tell you| it�s nice to be pain-free again. Thank you| Dr. Barcohana!�,5
87,Babak Barcohana| MD,�Starting back in September 2010| I was experiencing tremendous pain in my right leg from the lower back down to my food. I had tried Synvisc injections| cortisone shots| and braces| but nothing would relieve the pain. I was at the point where I could not even climb stairs. Dr. Barcohana had mention my best option was to fix the L5 vertebrae that was sitting on my tailbone as that was my best option to ease the pain. I wished I had listened to the doctor back in 2010. On January 3| 2011| I had a full right knee replacement due to the fact I had no meniscus and was scared about having back surgery. I was hoping that it would relieve the pain in my leg. My knee feels great and is working just fine| but the pain in back of my legs was getting worse. I was always told not to have back surgery because of the risk involved. I went and talked to Dr. Barcohana for the second time. He explained again in detail the procedure| the risks| and benefits involved| making me feel comfortable and relaxed enough to do it. It has been less than two months| and I feel great. The pain is almost non-existent. On both surgeries| the first week is a little rough. The relief I feel now and the mobility that I have gained back was well worth it and has exceeded my expectations. The treatment I received from pre-surgery and post-surgery was exceptional| professional| and courteous at all times. Dr. Barcohana's practice coordinator has been very helpful| tending to my needs and prescriptions. My wife and I own a medical supply store and I get customers coming in looking for braces for knee and back relief because they are afraid to have any surgeries. I explained the procedures I had| the outcome| and find out they are very surprised to see me only after two months after back surgery. The incision on my back is not even noticeable. I give them Dr. Barcohana cards and tell them to at least go talk to him. I am very grateful to have had my surgery done at SCOI and by Dr. Barcohana. I would recommend him to anyone that asks and to all of my customers.�,5
88,Babak Barcohana| MD,�My persistent back problems began in the 80�s. I had a car accident in my little Corolla with a big solid 1970�s vintage Cadillac. It won and I lost big time. I was in my mid-twenties and spent some time every year with back problems. I went to chiropractors| who could give some relief| medical practitioners who could give pain pills that would dull the pain but not help the underlying cause| acupuncture doctors who didn�t really help| physical therapy| and even paid extra money to use a stretching machine called the DRX. This did seem to help for a time. I also had some spinal block type treatments| which helped for almost a year the first time| but each subsequent time| helped for a shorter length of time. So in Fall of 2009| around Thanksgiving| I finally injured my back so much that I couldn�t work. I had missed up to a week at a time before| but had managed to struggle to work in pain until that year. I was trying desperately to avoid surgery on my back. My husband had back surgery around the time we were married| and his was successful. The doctor told him it would probably last 5 years| and it had been more than 15. However| in the research I had done online| you apparently had a fifty/fifty chance that surgery would help. I was very afraid at the thought of back surgery. What if it didn�t work and I couldn�t work now. Then I had the back surgery and that didn�t work| what would I do? Friends and relatives usually tried to talk me out of it. However| I had tried everything else. I knew I had to do something. So I made an appointment with SCOI to see a specialist| and it turned out to be the best thing I ever did. My back problems originally had started with only one disc that was damaged. Now it was two! Also| I had excess weight| which of course made everything worse. Walking| sitting| everything was difficult and extremely painful. So there I was at SCOI| talking with Dr. Barcohana. He told me that he thought he could help my back pain at least 50-70 percent. I thought I would be very happy with 25 percent by that time| but I agreed. We scheduled the surgery for the end of March 2010. The surgery itself was to remove the collapsed discs| L4-L5| and L5-S1| and replace them with cages. I would have two cages| 6 screws| and 1 titanium rod to hold them in. The surgery could take up to seven hours. So I set it up| and it turned out to be the best decision I had made in a very long time about my back. The surgery lasted about five and a half hours. I was able to get up the third day and start walking. The hardest part was being released and sitting in a car for an hour to get home. But even that wasn�t too painful. I received the best back brace I have ever had. After about six weeks| I began physical aqua therapy. I improved slowly and steadily. I originally began this letter around my first Halloween after my surgery| when it finally came home to me how much better I was with the surgery. Six months had gone by since my back surgery| and it was Halloween again. It occurred to me that this was the first Halloween parade at the school I teach at that I wasn�t worried about the pain from standing and walking so long and that I didn�t collapse at the end of the parade. I am able to walk| swim| and exercise at the YMCA| work and live again. I owe it all to you Dr. Barcohana and I thank you from the bottom of my heart!! �,5
89,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�I was having shoulder pain in my right shoulder. I saw Dr. Snyder ten years ago for the same issue| which he corrected. Recently| I had another flare up in my right shoulder| and I saw Dr. Snyder. I find Dr. Snyder to be professional| easy to talk with| and thorough in his treatment. The service provided was excellent.�,5
90,Trevor P. Lynch| MD| FACS,�I had tennis elbow pain for about six months. I saw two different doctors for treatment| which included having two separate cortisone shots. Then I saw Dr. Lynch the Valencia office| which then sent me over to David Hubert to SCOI�s Valencia�s Physical Therapy Department for ASTYM treatment. Within two and a half months of ASTYM and other treatment exercises| my tennis elbow is finally going away. I am so incredibly grateful to David for making me feel so much better! And the entire staff couldn't be any nicer. I would highly recommend them for anyone needing physical therapy treatment.�,5
91,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�He is very professional and caring. He is an excellent doctor. I would recommend Southern California Orthopedic Institue to everybody with any problem with their bones.�,5
92,Brian S. Grossman| MD,�On December 18| 2009| Dr. Grossman performed a four and a half hour tri-level fusion surgery on my neck. It entailed three bone grafts and installation of a metal plate with eight screws. Judging from my recovery and regaining full rotation of my neck| the work was flawless. Prior to surgery| my head pointed slightly left| my left shoulder was much higher than it should have been| my ability to function normally was restricted| and I was in pain. I was under his care during the recovery process for a year. Simply put| on my last visit with him| I referred to him as My hero. Enough said.�,5
93,Brian S. Grossman| MD,�I am a RN and work in a state prison. After 37 years of nursing| I had never so much as even strained my back and then I slip at work and hurt my back. It took a few months| but I finally got in to see Dr. Grossman. Even though it had been 5 months since my accident| I still hadn't had a MRI. Dr. Grossman ordered one immediately and when he saw it| he said I needed surgery. I said something like back surgeries don't do well| having seen many patients who had to have them redone. He responded that in cases like mine| where there was a specific area that needed surgery| they do very well. I decided to try and be the good employee and was going to wait until I couldn't stand the pain any more. Long story short| I discovered that my Workers Comp had a deadline for me to have a surgical procedure and return to work. I went back to Dr. Grossman| had another MRI| and had surgery in April of 2009. I woke up in recovery room and my leg pain was completely gone! He later told me the surgery went perfectly! Today| 4 years later| I am still without the symptoms that plagued me after my fall. To say I am grateful is an understatement. I will always be very grateful to Dr. Grossman for giving me back my life. I have had surgery by other Southern California Orthopedic Institute physicians and refer all of my friends to Southern California Orthopedic Institute.�,5
94,Babak Barcohana| MD,�After suffering a pinched nerve and severe back and leg pain an MRI revealed that I was experiencing a severe degree of central canal narrowing| or stenosis| caused by a disc herniation. I opted to schedule the earliest possible surgery. Upon my recovery from the five hour surgery| I was informed that all had gone well. The afternoon of the surgery| I was able to walk the length of the hallway twice. The second and third day| I was able to increase the walking distance during three daily walks. These two days proved to be the most painful| with a rapid abatement of pain from then on. I was released on the fourth day| which was the last day I required prescription pain medication. On the sixth day| when I awoke| the pain had all but disappeared. In my opinion| the keys to success in this procedure and subsequent recovery were the outstanding skill| knowledge| and attention to detail of Dr. Barcohana and a concerted effort to optimize physical conditioning and especially core strengthening prior to surgery. Beyond this| the SCOI Physical Therapy Department has proven extremely beneficial in my return to good health and normal activities. My sincere thanks to Dr. Barcohana| and my best wishes to him in his continuing efforts to enhance his patient's health and quality of life.�,5
95,Babak Barcohana| MD,�It has been one year since you operated on my back. I am writing to tell you that my back feels great| thanks to your excellent work. I have enjoyed a year of renewed physical activity without the discomfort I had before the surgery. I will be forever grateful for your skills as a surgeon. Thank you.�,5
96,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�My daughter Rebecca went to Dr. Getelman due to knee pain. She is a long distance track runner in high school. Previous doctors told her it was runners knee. But Dr. Getelman ordered an MRI and found a torn meniscus. He did surgery and he was amazing throughout the entire process. His office staff is friendly and professional and the surgery center staff was remarkable. For a nervous teenager's first surgery| I could not have wished for a better doctor| team| or outcome. He even made a video of the surgery for her. I will never look elsewhere for an orthopedist. Both Rebecca and I are both ecstatic with entire experience.�,5
97,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I feel very well. I have had previous lumbar spine L5-S1 and interbody L5-S1 surgery with another surgeon. Because of this trauma and from all the problems from the previous surgeries| I was very fearful to have another spinal surgery. I was injured at Fry�s Electronics and worked for the DWP for a while. I was very mechanical and the pain got so bad in my shoulder| which affected my hand also. I finally saw Dr. Barcohana and I�m very grateful with the doctor and staff. They have fantastic demeanor. Everyone at SCOI is very attentive and I would recommend the surgery to everyone. I feel very hopeful after 2 � yrs of pain. I had surgery a couple of months ago and feel great. I now am pain free. I want everyone to know that I have now had three major surgeries on my spine with the SCOI unit. This unit and Dr. Barcohana are wonderful. The physical therapy in Valencia is great. I would be willing to recommend to everyone.�,5
98,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I had contacted another orthopedic group| recommended by my physician. They seemed to be more concerned with my age than actually treating me. They wanted to put everything off and try therapy. I consulted with my wife and my physician. I complained that just because said doctor had once treated Ronald Reagan| he felt he was too important to treat me. Dr. Wilton DelPizzo had worked on my right shoulder in 2006. I contacted him| knowing he was now retired| and asked him to recommend someone at Southern California Orthopedic Institute. He recommended a few doctors at Southern California Orthopedic Institute and I made an appointment. Dr. Getelman�s assistant was interviewing me when he came in and looked at my MRI's. He stated that the injury should have been treated within 90 days of the injury. He stated that the odds were 80-20 of full recovery. We made the appointment and I am now in rehab. I am very happy with my progress. The personnel in rehab are also top notch.�,5
99,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I just turned 65. I�m in good health except for a back injury. A big back injury! I do not know the when| but it was about 5 years ago. I tried everything. My walking became limited and my legs ached| mostly at night. No one seemed to isolate the problem. Finally I saw this chart that referenced my L3 and L4 vertebrae. There was a bulge. I decided to see a specialist. I started locally but realized I needed to go somewhere else. I picked The Southern California Orthopedic Institute in Van Nays| CA. I took the MRI I did locally to SCOI. What I had was my L3| L4| L5 crushing my nerve. Operation was May 7| it was a Tuesday. I was released on Thursday. Today is Wednesday May 15th and I�m doing well. I can walk unassisted. I had some rough moments. Now my legs don�t hurt all night. I sit up with no help. I can go up and down a couple of steps without a cane. I didn�t need to use pain pills as it was not as bad as I thought it would be. I lost my ability to hike. Maybe I can do it again. As soon as the Doctor says I will start exercising. Having surgery is not a small matter. My Surgeon was Dr. Bob Barcohana. I am pleased with the staff of SCOI| and the stay at Valley Presbyterian Hospital. They took very good care of me. I feel I made a good choice.�,1
100,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�I am very pleased with everyone I have come into contact with at Southern California Orthopedic Institute. They are all very professional and take great pride with the patient and needs of the patient. I trust all of the doctors I see at Southern California Orthopedic Institute. Dr. Ferkel| Dr. Gazmarian| and Dr. Hanker are just great.�,5
101,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�About four years ago| I had an ACL graft on my right knee at age 51. I had injured my knee 10 years earlier and put off having surgery| until it became necessary to fix this| so my knee wouldn't lock up during regular activities. Surgery was outpatient and I followed with physical therapy until my insurance ran out. A few months later| I learned about an optimal health program| which I did and lost 15 lbs. in the first month| created better eating habits| becoming regularly active and optimally healthy. I now feel younger| healthier| and am more active than I was 10 years ago| as well as look great! I am proud to say that at 55| I am better than ever. I am enjoying my health and activities| which I had thought were in my past.�,5
102,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I am a 73 yr. old woman. I retired from Los Angeles Unified School District in 1994. I've always had a back problem| but it became worse after a fall. The pain extended from the lower back down to the buttocks and into both legs and feet. After 2 epidurals| no relief. The Orthopedic doctor who had done them referred me to Dr. Barcohana| a spinal surgeon. The thought of surgery scared me to death. I remember hearing 'Oh| don't have any back surgery they might make it worse.' But the pain was affecting my mobility and any activities| such as shopping. When I arrived to see Dr. Barcohana I was in a wheelchair. I was so unsteady on my feet I couldn't use a walker. I was so nervous and apprehensive I didn't ask any questions. To this day I don't know what he did but it was miracle. Four days in the hospital| by the third day I was getting out of bed by myself and walking a few steps in the hall way with assistance. After 10 wks. of aqua therapy and land therapy I am doing well. I can sit| stand up| walk upstairs with hand rails and in house stairs. Cannot walk in heels yet but that's O.K. �,5
103,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�Dr. Hamilton treated me for two knee replacements| Robert Brennan| Physician's treated me for a dislocated right elbow and Dr. Stephen Schopler| did two back vertebroplastys| which left me without agonizing back pain. He rocks as a doctor. He has an excellent medical assistant named Melisa. Glad Southern California Orthopedic Institute is in Bakersfield.�,5
104,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�The purpose of this note is to commend Dr. Guanche| his staff| including| but not limited to Monica Castillo and Surgery Center Nurse Sharon| and Southern California Orthopedic Institute. I tore my right hamstring back in February of 2013. My HMO| due to how delicate it is to perform this type of procedure| referred me to Dr. Guanche. My doctor was honest enough to tell me he had only performed one of these procedures and recommended Dr. Guanche operates on me. My surgery was scheduled for Monday| June 17| the day after Father's day. I have had two shoulder surgeries and one knee surgery| but I had never been as nervous as I was for my hamstring surgery. During my consultation with Dr. Guanche| he took the time to thoroughly explain to me how my procedure would be performed| the timeline for my healing and therapy| and he asked me if I had any questions. I could not think of any at the time and I went home. Needless to say| all the questions came to mind on Father's Day and I emailed a list of my questions to Monica. I wasn�t expecting an answer from her until Monday while en-route to the surgery center. I was pleasantly surprised when Monica replied on Father's Day and answered all of my questions. From the moment I arrived for my pre-op until I left the surgery center| everyone who was involved with my surgery treated me with the utmost courtesy and professionalism. When I saw Monica| I thanked her for replying on Father's Day and I told her I was nervous. She set me at ease by telling me I was in good hands and I had nothing to worry about. The great treatment continued through the rest of my day. My assigned nurse| Sharon| was very caring and patiently while prepping me for my surgery. She was even more patient after my surgery while dressing me| giving my son my post op care instructions| and wheeling me to my car. I had to give her a hug before we left for home. When I arrived home after my procedure| I emailed Monica. I asked her to thank everyone who was involved with me| for the way they treated me during my procedure. I also told her she was correct in telling me I was in good hands. This is a first class surgery center| staffed with first class professionals. I would definitely recommend Southern California Orthopedic Institute to anyone who needs to have a surgical procedure.�,2
105,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�Dr. Karzel did an AMAZING job on my torn meniscus. It�s been two months and I'm back to working out. I'm a personal trainer and fitness instructor| teaching Boot Camp and High Intensity Interval Training.I modify a bit but overall| my knee feels wonderful| with no pain or swelling. Thank you Dr. Karzel for your expertise and great manner. I recommend Dr. Karzel to anyone who tells me they are having knee issues. I hope I never do again| but if I ever have issues| he will be my surgeon!�,5
106,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�Dr. Jaivin performed surgery on my foot this past February. I had a previous surgery from a doctor from another facility| which had not healed properly. Dr. Jaivin corrected problems| which were not resolved in the previous surgery. I had consulted with several doctors| who would not perform the surgery. I spent months researching doctors. It appeared that Dr. Jaivin was the best doctor for my surgery. Both Dr. Jaivin and his staff were awesome! My medical care and results of my surgery were better than I ever expected. I would recommend Dr. Jaivin to anybody requiring foot surgery!�,5
107,Todd Shapiro| MD,�My experience has been nothing short of fantastic. I had major rotator cuff surgery and had ZERO pain. ZERO...as in NONE whatsoever in my shoulder after the surgery. The only reason why I took any pain medication was due to fluid build up around my elbow and forearm due to normal drainage| but that was no worse than a mild headache. By the third day| I was only using half of one at night. I was totally off of pain pills within six or seven days. Yes| it was a pain being in a sling for five weeks and the rehab time is lengthy| but the actual surgery experience was excellent. From pre-op to release| the only thing I had any trouble with was riding home in the car| which I got a little woozy from that| but once I got home| ate a couple hours later| got hooked up to the ice machine| I was good. While I don't wish rotator surgery on anyone| if you have to have it done| this is the place to do it. I would recommend Southern California Orthopedic Institute and especially Dr. Shapiro| to anyone. PS...I have had NO pain issues in physical therapy either....NONE.�,1
108,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�Dr. Karzel did an AMAZING job on my torn meniscus. It�s been two months and I'm back to working out. I'm a personal trainer and fitness instructor| teaching Boot Camp and High Intensity Interval Training. I modify a bit but overall| my knee feels wonderful| with no pain or swelling. Thank you Dr. Karzel for your expertise and great manner. I recommend Dr. Karzel to anyone who tells me they are having knee issues. I hope I never do again| but if I ever have issues| he will be my surgeon!�,5
109,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�I was having shoulder pain in my right shoulder. I saw Dr. Snyder ten years ago for the same issue| which he corrected. Recently| I had another flare up in my right shoulder| and I saw Dr. Snyder. I find Dr. Snyder to be professional| easy to talk with| and thorough in his treatment. The service provided was excellent.�,4
110,Trevor P. Lynch| MD| FACS,�I had tennis elbow pain for about six months. I saw two different doctors for treatment| which included having two separate cortisone shots. Then I saw Dr. Lynch the Valencia office| which then sent me over to David Hubert to SCOI�s Valencia�s Physical Therapy Department for ASTYM treatment. Within two and a half months of ASTYM and other treatment exercises| my tennis elbow is finally going away. I am so incredibly grateful to David for making me feel so much better! And the entire staff couldn't be any nicer. I would highly recommend them for anyone needing physical therapy treatment.�,5
111,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�He is very professional and caring. He is an excellent doctor. I would recommend Southern California Orthopedic Institue to everybody with any problem with their bones.�,5
112,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I came in for treatment of a work comp injury to my knee. I knew something wasn't right and after an MRI it was confirmed that I had a small tear to the medial meniscus and some arthritis. I was presented with a few options and opted for surgery to resolve the pain and begin the healing. Now a week post surgery and the pain is gone. I could not be happier to be on the road to recovery with no more pain. All the staff at SCOI have been very kind and caring. I am thankful to be in their capable hands.�,5
113,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I saw Dr. Guanche for a torn labrum in my left hip in late 2012. I had surgery on January 23| 2013. Although I was in a lot of pain when I woke up from the anesthesia| the meds nurse Judy gave me helped 100%. By the time I got into the car| I had 0 pain. I took my pain meds every few hours and in a few days| I was able to put weight on my leg and started feeling better. I called many times regarding pain and concerns. The whole staff at Dr. Guanche's office was amazing. They never made me feel like my question and concerns were not important. It has taken a while but I am feeling better all the time. I still have some pain when I first stand up and I'm still trying to stretch and strengthen those muscles| but I am no longer in the pain I was in. I heard great things about Dr. Guanche from doctors all over Orange County where I live. I would strongly recommend Dr. Guanche and his staff at Southern California Orthopedic Institute.�,5
114,Todd Shapiro| MD,�I was experiencing major shoulder pain for over four years. When physical therapy did not improve my condition| I came to Dr. Shapiro| who performed minor surgery and now has me on the road to a pain-free life. I am very pleased with my experience with Southern California Orthopedic Institute. Their friendly staff and expert doctors are great!�,5
115,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�I can't say enough good things about my experience at Southern California Orthopedic Institute. From the first diagnostic appointment to the MRI to surgery and post-op appointments| Dr. Snyder and all of the staff has been on time| organized| and thorough. This is unheard of in the medical world. Their process| paperwork| DVD| and website answered every question I had about the surgery. But they still called me several times before and after to continue to explain things and answer any questions I might have. Finally| the billing appears to be accurate!�,5
116,John L. Etcheverry| DPM,�My knee is somewhat unique in that I do not know what I did to injure it. I started doing some exercise including| yoga and my knee started to really bother me. I have enjoyed seeing PA Brennon| Dr. Hamilton. Dr. Hamilton did a great job. I was pleased that he spent time with me before and after surgery. Even though all of this is new to me| Brennon is willing to answer my questions and also tell me that it is just arthritis| something I will have to get use to. Not easy mind you| but at least I can tell the difference. Brennon is willing to see me for any issues I may feel have arrived as well as usually having a joke to tell me too. I do feel more reassured due to Brennon because he is going through similar issues with his knees. I feel he is a bit more sympathetic and understanding. I then ended up seeing Dr. Etcheverry for a hammertoe that was really giving me pain and I asked if I could have the same anesthesiologist. He did his best and I was happy to know I was able to have the same anesthesiologist. That was one less worry on my plate for surgery and Dr. Etcheverry spent time with me before and after surgery too. I asked Dr. Etcheverry what I could do to possibly prevent my other toes from the same surgery and he gave me a few hints| for which I'm thankful. For me| if there is anything that Southern California Orthopedic Institute can do if I'm having problems again| I will go there FIRST if at all possible! I find everyone there caring| nice| and considerate. Everyone gets behind at times| but at least they are willing to inform you of that. It also happened when I called to make an appointment| but I was not on the books for that day. They worked hard to find me a replacement appointment that fit my schedule and as early as possible. Things do happen at time| no one is perfect| but they do a great job at trying to make it right. I have referred a couple of people to Southern California Orthopedic Institute since I have been going there for a year and a half.�,5
117,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�My husband had a torn three tendons in his rotator cuff. The injuries were old and the muscles had pulled away. Dr. Bahk is a miracle worker! He was able to attach the tendons! My husband can do most of the shoulder functions now. I do recommend Dr. Bahk to anyone with orthopedic needs.�,5
118,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�One month ago today| I had a total replacement of my right knee. Today| I feel almost 100% recuperated. I can't believe it. Dr. Hernandez is excellent| a very good friend| and tremendous orthopedist. All the people working for him in his office| at Southern California Orthopedic Institute| are very professional| and very concerned about Dr. Hernandez's patients. I am talking about Angie and Ann in particular. Thanks to all of you| for all you are doing and for all you have done. One thing is left| and is my outpatient physical therapy| concern about my economical situation| bills| payments| and physical therapy. Thanks so much!�,5
119,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Dr. Hernandez performed a hip resurfacing for me back in July 2011. Him and his staff were wonderful as was and is the entire experience. I recommend him every chance I get. Thanks Dr. Hernandez!�,5
120,Paul M. Simic| MD,�I was treated by Dr. Simic for a fractured left arm due to a fall. I can't say enough great things about SCOI. My surgery experience at SCOI and Dr. Simic couldn't have been different. Everyone was caring and compassionate. I didn't feel like a member of a herd but rather an individual. My follow-up appointments with Dr. Simic have also been a great experience. His assistant Jordan is fabulous. When you are injured you are vulnerable. SCOI makes you feel safe and secure. Can't say enough good things about everyone at SCOI.�,5
121,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�My cycling partner and chief of orthopedic surgery for Kaiser Woodland Hills referred me to Southern California Orthopedic Institute. As an aging career athlete| my body was showing signs of wear and tear. I have been the exception to the rule in that I want the quick fix with surgery and everyone I have seen at Southern California Orthopedic Institute has been conservative and traditional. The results have exceeded my expectations and improved my athletic performances in all distances of triathlons including the Ironman. I have even returned to marathon running without issue. I will never see another doctor outside of Southern California Orthopedic Institute. As an added bonus| Southern California Orthopedic Institute has the best nursing staff and physician assistants around. Tracy was there every step of the way| recommending each specialist and constantly checking on my progress because she cares and truly loves her job!�,5

124,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I broke my knee in half and was treated by a doctor in Beverly Hills. This doctor was not a healer and did not treat me with respect. He did such a bad job that my knee did not heal and the one screw he put in was not enough to hold my knee and it broke again. I thank god that a friend recommended SCOI. Dr. Getelman| along with his team| not only treated me with respect but really cared about helping me heal. They showed compassion for what I had gone through. I was guided through every step of my healing process by Dr. Getelman's team| by the surgery department| and by the physical therapy department. I felt cared for and respected. My body| mind| and soul were taken care of by the wonderful staff at SCOI.�,4
125,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�I'm a 25-year-old active duty officer in the air force and I was injured in 2011 in the line of duty as a paramedic. I had a failed ankle surgery last year. But Dr Jaivin�s team has been amazing. Not only am I back to working| but looking at being able to deploy again. They have been a blessing and an amazing team to work with. I send all our military personal to SCOI and I feel like they�re family now to me. I'm so grateful for them giving me my life and my career back to keep our country safe.�,5
126,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I tore my meniscus in my left knee and had five knee injections in late summer 2010. Saw great improvement in my knee in terms of pain and flexibility. At 9:00 p.m. on 9/11/11| my husband was driving our Honda Accord on the freeway and suffered a brain aneurism. When I felt the sudden acceleration of the car and he was non-responsive to my screams and pleas to slow down. Later| I was told we were driving at 90 miles p/hr! I grabbed the steering wheel and avoided hitting cars until I clipped a car| it spun out of control and I must have lost consciousness. When I woke up| I was in the arms of paramedics and was cut out of car with Jaws of Life. Freeway was closed for 2 and 1/2 hours and we were rushed to Northridge Hospital Trauma unit. My husband never regained consciousness and I was admitted| where I was treated for a dislocated hip| fractured nose| and later two craniotomies| one following upon the heels of the first. I suffered a hemorrhagic stroke twice. The remaining months of 2011 and much of 2012 were spent trying to rebuild my body and my life. I am walking again without any assistance and grateful that I can re-pay in some small way| all that I received by volunteering at the hospital. My knees are still numb and my left leg and foot are often swollen. I am once again back at SCOI for knee injections| hoping that in spite of arthritis in those knees| I will see improvement. Stacey and I have great hopes for the future. I am grateful to her and Dr. Getelman.�,5
127,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�I recently had shoulder surgery by Dr. Karzel. He was very understanding and explained the entire procedure| explaining the worse scenario to the least so there were no surprises. I'm recovering very well from my surgery. Everyone at the Van Nuys surgical center was very friendly and professional| from the front office to surgical techs. They made me feel like I was their only patient for the day. Thank you to everyone!�,4

130,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�Spectacular recovery from my surgery in August 2011 for multiple rotator cuff tears. I believe I received the top quality care from the surgeon and his team| my adherence to their gradual timetable for rehabilitation| and the excellence of my physical therapist. Instead of up to a two year surgery recovery period -- yet with no guarantee I could return to my sport -- I have been able to resume to full activities in a little over 12 months. SCOI deserves high praise! -- Tom S.�,5
131,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I have a history of low back pain| including three herniated discs. All of a sudden| I was experiencing extreme pain in my right hip. I saw Dr. Guanche and after an x-ray| he told me there some arthritis in my hip. Using the ultrasound machine| he gave me a painless injection and within 24 hours| my hip was pain free. I am very grateful!! So great!�,5
132,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�I thought I just had an injury due to a spinnaker accident while on vacation. I knew I had torn my rotator cuff| but did not realize I had other injuries as well. Dr. Karzel saw a bone spur and possible tears in my biceps. My biceps ended up being frayed and needed repair also. I was really upset I had to have surgery because I did not want ugly scars on my shoulder. I know that sounds vain| but I wanted to be able to wear sleeveless tops confidentially. To my amazement| not only are the scars nearly invisible| but my down time was only two weeks before I went back to work. Dr. Karzel and the staff at SCOI were truly friendly and made me feel completely at ease and I knew I was in good hands. If I have to have another surgery| there is nowhere else I would even consider. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.�,5
133,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I met Dr. Getelman after I had torn my ACL during a basketball game. It was the most horrifying experience I have ever faced. Luckily Dr. Getelman and his team were there to the rescue. They assessed my right knee and informed me of the options for my repair. Everyone in the office was friendly whether it was Stacy tag teaming with Dr. Getelman| Marissa scheduling my appointments| or anyone else on staff otherwise taking care of me. My initial visit was in January of this year. My surgery was completed in February| and now after months of physical therapy| I have been cleared to rejoin my sport. I knew when I first met him| that Super Doctor| Mark Getelman| would be able to help me recover from my ACL injury. Now that I am at the end of my journey| I could not be more happy with the expert care I received from Dr. Getelman| his P.A. Stacy| and the rest of the SCOI staff. Thankyou so much. You guys rock!�,5
134,William H. Mouradian| MD,�I recently went to see Dr. Mouradian for the first time. He was very careful to examine me and explain my conditions to me in plain English! When it comes time to have my lower back surgery| I trust that he will do an excellent job. Thanks for coming out to help us in Ridgecrest!�,5
135,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�Dr. Schamblin recently repaired my massive rotator cuff tear. He is of course an excellent surgeon| but equally important is his bedside manner and the time he takes explaining procedures| easing fears and made me feel like I�m the most important guy in the room. In short he is a quality surgeon and a very nice man. Secondarily| his support staff (Janelle and Edna) and his PA Leslie Lucero are equally helpful and engaging. This is my second surgery experience with SCOI in the past two years and the entire experience was very positive. -- Dr. Michael H.�,4
136,Kamil Erfanian| MD,�Earlier this year| I went to see Dr. Hamilton for extreme pain in my right shoulder. This has been an ongoing condition for approximately five years. I expected the need for some type of treatment but x-rays indicated the need for a complete shoulder replacement. I agreed to the treatment but was surprised to learn he was scheduled about five months out. I told him and his nurse that if that if there were any cancelations in his schedule that I would be ready to take the first available date. I received a call the next day informing me that there was an opening the following week and was given a list of labs and tests that were needed prior to surgery. Dr. Hamilton's office was extremely helpful in making all of those tests happen and I had surgery the following week. It went exactly as Dr. Hamilton explained and he went the extra mile to make sure both my wife and I understood the post surgery behaviors and expectations. Each follow-up visit has been very positive| with progress on range of motion and strength. I am very pleased with my diagnosis and treatment by both Dr. Hamilton and each of his staff members. I highly recommend SCOI for all orthopedic needs. I have seen Dr. Erfanian for another issue and was equally pleased with diagnosis and treatment.�,5

138,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I am an SVPD Police Officer with 17 years of street experience. I was brutally injured by a mental health patient| which resulted in a fully torn right knee PCL. Dr. Bahk was great and I was back to work full duty in four months. While I am still healing| Dr. Bahk was amazing and did a great job. Dr. Bahk and his nurse kept my spirits high while providing me with the best care| which not only saved my career| but also allowed me to return full field duty quickly. Thank you Dr. Bahk and all of the SCOI staff.�,5
139,Brian S. Grossman| MD,�It has truly been a blessing to meet Dr. Grossman and his staff. They are professional and compassionate. They can't speed up the workman's comp process but being treated with respect and compassion is worth more than a million bucks. I thank you all| including the administration and ancillary staff for your kindness! Dr. Grossman| I know you've been practicing for quite some time and you're an expert in your field| but you haven't lost compassion for your patients. That's the characteristic that's earned you my trust and respect. Thank you! -- Jorina P.�,4
140,Babak Barcohana| MD,�Dr. Barcohana has changed my life! My lower back after a work incident left me in a lot of pain. Today my mobility has improved and my cane use is now late in the day and for my walks. Dr. Burns also helped my shoulder as my cane use to irritate my shoulder socket. Today| I feel better and thank SCOI for all their help. -- Gary L.�,5
141,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�I would like to thank Dr. Ferkel for always putting me back together after one of my injuries. I would also like to thank him for allowing me to go back to the activities I love and not telling me to just go find something else to do. He is a true sports medicine doctor who gets you back to your sports if at all possible. He understands the mindset of athletes and their need to be active. After seventeen knee surgeries| two shoulder surgeries| and one foot surgery I am still able to be active. Thanks for your patience and superb care!�,5
142,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�I suffered with knee pain that made it difficult to work and| at age 78| I loved my job| my associates and the guests that came into our local Williams-Sonoma Shoppe. As a retired administrative assistant and widow| this little part-time job is very important to my well-being. Dr. Ferkel performed arthrocopic surgery and I thought I would have a stiff knee forever| but after two months| he aspirated my knee and suddenly I was well on my way to recovery! My knee wasn't stiff anymore and I completed physical therapy and I am doing fine. I'm back to work after two months and couldn't be happier. This procedure relieved the pressure in my knee area. Thank you Dr. Ferkel!�,5
143,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�Dr. Ferkel operated on my right foot this past February. Prior to my surgery I had been in pain for two years with a torn posterior tibial tendon. Besides repairing the tendon| Dr. Ferkel repositioned my heel and basically gave me a new foot. I now have very little pain and my foot and ankle are so much stronger then before I had the surgery. I interviewed the best foot and ankle surgeons in the Los Angeles area and I am so glad I chose Dr. Ferkel as my surgeon. He is the best. I also think your physical therapy department is the best. The physical therapists were kind| explained what they were doing| and greatly helped in my recovery. I will be having my left foot operated on next year with Dr. Ferkel and will also be using your physical therapy department. I can't say enough good things about your institute. Thank you again.�,4
144,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�Besides waiting a while for authorization for surgery| the whole experience was quite enjoyable. The entire staff of SCOI was very friendly and made me feel welcomed. Janelle| Dr. Schamblin's main office clerk| is simply the best. She makes sure you are satisfied with your visit and aftercare. Dr. Schamblin himself is excellent and you never have to worry if he is doing the right thing or if everything is going to turn out okay. From initial visit to aftercare| they are simply the best.�,5
145,A. Elizabeth Bloz�| MD,�Dr. Friedman replaced both on my knees in the spring of 2009 and they are working very well. I've also had very good results from working with Dr. Lynch (elbow)| Dr. Bloze (spine)| Dr. Karzel (knee arthroscopy)| and Dr. Jaivin (ankle).�,4
146,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�I will be having my other shoulder cuff repair on the 25th of July. I had the right in 2010 and now I will have my left. My youngest son had shoulder repay in May and is doing very well. My first surgery went very well and I am very happy with the results. I know the left one will be just as good. I would recommend SCOI to everyone and I am especially happy with Dr. Schamblin| Leslie| Janelle| and Edna. They are a great team.�,5
147,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I am 80 years young. In my case| 80 is the new 60! I have been fortunate to be healthy all my life| requiring no illness| no hospitalizations| and taking very medication. I came to SCOI because I had a hip issue and it turned out necessary to replace. I was astonished! Dr. Hernandez met me the first consult and he was truly caring| understood the mechanics of the area| and explained it to me in a way I completely understood. He was terrific. My hospitalization and procedure of the total hip replacement| was a positive one. I breezed through it. Dr Hernandez made it possible for me to have an excellent recovery. I had physical therapy with SCOI at the Thousand Oaks location| near my home| making it easy. They did insist I work hard to conquer the intense recovery. I was extremely happy with Dr. Hernandez| his expertise| laid-back manner| and his excellent ability to perform the difficult surgery. I plan on doing my second hip this year! That speaks volumes for SCOI but| especially| Dr. Hernandez in particular. Thank you to all for the help| encourage and support.�,5
148,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I broke my femur playing softball on Memorial Day Weekend in San Diego. They repaired my femur and after a couple months| I developed intense pain in my same right leg above the knee. For months| I went from doctor to doctor and they thought that the problem was a blood clot| which I did have. I was prescribed blood thinners but the pain was still there. Not until April 2012| did Dr Jaime Hernandez take special x-rays and I was diagnosed with Leoimayasarcoma cancer and rushed to USC hospital for chemo & radiation. I was then told from three different doctors at USC| UCLA| & City of Hope that my leg would need to be amputated. But then thanks to my fianc� and her determination| found a doctor in NY. In Dec. 2012| after a 21-hour surgery| they were able to remove the cancer| vascular reconstruct my leg and transfer a muscle from my back to be put in my leg. I have been back from NY since the middle of February and have gone from the pool at SCOI to ground exercises and walk with a cane now! I am a walking miracle.�,5
149,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I had a total knee replacement done by Dr. Hernandez and he did a wonderful job. He is a terrific guy and always listens to the patient�s concerns. He will be operating on my other knee shortly and I look forward to seeing his smiling face!!�,1
150,Brian S. Grossman| MD,�After being denied a procedure for spinal fusion surgery to my lower lumbar area by two other doctors| Dr. Brian Grossman accepted the task. He and his team were very professional and made me feel confident in their abilities. After surgery| I felt that all went well and I was assured things did. I am only three weeks out of the procedure and am healing and recovering well. I am looking forward to a full recovery with complete mobility| pain free!�,5
151,Kamil Erfanian| MD,�Dr. Erfanian had treated my right broken hand. Working in law enforcement and my right hand being my dominant hand| it was vital that I get the best treatment| so I can continue my career in Law Enforcement. Dr. Erfanian did an amazing job with the surgery. My right hand has fully healed and I am back out protecting and serving the community.�,5

154,Kamil Erfanian| MD,�After my fracture healed| I was still having problems. I was referred to Dr. Erfanian. The first time we meet| he was so nice. But later I did have to have surgery. The staff at Southern California Orthopedic Institute was fantastic! They were very caring and oh so nice. Southern California Orthopedic Institute is the best place to go when you need orthopedic care. Thanks Dr. Erfanian for everything!�,5
155,Kamil Erfanian| MD,�Dr. Erfanian was my physician. He examined my hand| confirmed I needed carpel tunnel surgery| and prepared me for the surgery. Everyone was courteous| kind| and professional. All went very well. The facilities are immaculate. I would recommend SCOI to my family and friends.�,5
156,Patricia C. McKeever| MD,�It was a very nice appointment. I was worried that I had a fracture in my hand| but x-rays showed everything was fine. We came to SCOI again because the amazing Dr. Patricia McKeever treated our daughter Madelaine almost 20 years ago for a benign unicameral bone cyst. We are so grateful. Maddy is 26 now and doing great. We are so deeply grateful to Dr. McKeever for her help and expertise. SCOI rocks!�,5
157,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�The experience has been nothing but top notch from the start. It was very professional and caring. I had a terrible tear in my rotator cuff and thanks to SCOI and Dr. Snyder's skill| I have use of my shoulder once again. Since I am active with outdoor activities through family and volunteering with Boy Scouts| full recovery was very important for my quality of life. I will look to SCOI for any future needs.�,5
158,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�This is the second time I went to Dr. Snyder. The first time was many| many years ago for frozen shoulder. A Thousand Oaks orthopedic surgeon misdiagnosed me with rotator cuff problems| which required surgery. Thankfully| I did not need surgery but I did need physical therapy| which cured my condition. This time| after enduring several weeks of a rather sudden and intense onset of pain in my left shoulder and having moved to the Central Coast of California four years ago| I didn't waste any time thinking about going to a doctor up here. I called and got an appointment with Dr. Snyder that week! After getting X-rays right away on my shoulder and then a thorough consult and physical exam by Dr. Snyder| I was diagnosed with a calcification on my right shoulder| which had been causing the pain. Dr. Snyder explained my condition| treatment options| and I decided on a having a cortisone shot| which I wasn't looking forward to. To my surprise| it wasn't as bad as I anticipated and within a day or so| my shoulder was feeling much better. Fast forward two weeks now| I am 99% pain free and hope it stays that way. Dr. Snyder and his staff were efficient| courteous| and thorough in treating me. I am relieved of my pain and I am grateful to have such a great doctor| even if I have to drive a few hours to see him. Thank you| Dr. Snyder! -- Dr. Belinda S.�,5
159,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�Initially| I was concerned about under going the shoulder surgery due to my advanced age. Dr. Karzel had new x-rays taken| studied them and said| I can fix your shoulder. Those were the words I needed to hear. Then as I went to various medical offices for my medical clearances| I was always asked whom my surgeon was. When I answered Dr. Karzel| I was always told that he was the best and a therapist| whom I have known for years| recommended him. I am totally pleased with the results of the surgery and recovery to date. My therapist has released me recently. -- Mickey B.�,5
160,Paul M. Simic| MD,�After being treated unsuccessfully by two other doctors at a different office| I was given three very painful shots by them that were injected at the base of my middle finger for what they called a trigger finger. I was told I was scheduled to have surgery that would definitely fix my problem. The upper fleshy part of my hand was also painfully swollen and with my middle finger not being able to withstand any pressure without great pain| my left hand was basically useless and my problem becoming frightening. So I sought a second opinion. I called my doctor| explained the first doctor wanted to do surgery| and asked for another referral first. She recommended Dr. Paul Simic at the Southern California Orthopedic Institute. I called him immediately. I did not know him| nor had I ever heard of him before. The office staff immediately instilled confidence in me. When I first saw his assistant| who looked at my X-rays and explained things to me| I knew I was in a better place than my last doctor's office. Sill| I had doubts of another shot doing any good at all. Dr. Simic came in| examined my hand| looked at x-rays| and then communicated everything about my problem with greater clarity as well as in a far better manner| a much greater bedside manner| if you will| than the other doctors. He asked me if when I had received the previous shots| my finger had ever felt as if it was kind of filling up. I said| no. Never. And told him how VERY PAINFUL those shots had been and that the doctor who gave me two of the shots seemed like| on the last shot| he was looking for the correct spot as he TWISTED the needle around| causing much of the pain. I was certainly not looking forward to going through that again. He carefully re-examined my finger and then said that he felt that it was a good chance a shot would work and might prevent surgery. Everything about him and his office inspired me. I agreed to it. As he was about to give me the shot and anticipating the pain| I took out a handkerchief| stuck it in my mouth and bit down on it. Well| the shot was over quickly| my finger did have a painless sensation of feeling as if the fluid was filling it up. The shot was almost pain free and I knew almost immediately that it was working. I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE DIFFERANCE IN MY VISIT TO THIS DOCTOR| NIGHT AND DAY. DR. SIMIC PERFORMED THIS MANEUVER SO MUCH BETTER than my previous encounters. I felt that he had fixed my problem. My hand/finger has been better than it has been in a couple of years. That was on 9.3.2013. Today| almost five weeks later| I can say that the only time it has acted up| was after a visit to the market| when I carried to my car three or four very heavy plastic bags in each hand. They pulled down hard at the base of my middle finger in my left hand. Though I was concerned about the fresh pain for a few days. It went away and has not returned. It is very important to me. I have not called Dr. Simic's office since to share my experience with him| so please pass this on to him so that he knows how very much he is appreciated. Also| please tell him that I did tell my doctor| and the folks at the MPH home| how very exceptional he was| and that they should refer people to him from now on. I raved about how good he was. They said that they would. You have my permission to use any or all of this in order to reach people and let them know what an extraordinary| and brilliant doctor that Paul Simic has been for me. Thank you.�,5
161,Todd Shapiro| MD,�I was in a horseback riding incident on July 29. The emergency room X-rays showed a shattered humerus at the head| joining the shoulder. I have a good friend that works for SCOI| and she highly recommended Dr. Shapiro. I called the next morning| explained my circumstances| and the receptionist got me an appointment the very next day. I found Dr. Shapiro to be kind| knowledgeable| and good at explaining what my healing would entail. I've also had many visits with Carrie. She's great!! She is honest| understanding| and my questions are always answered. The staff there is great and top notch. X-ray machines and the techs are gentle! I�m thrilled with my experience at this facility| even though this was definitely the worst injury of my life so far!�,4
162,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I had pain for several months in my hip and groin. I finally went to SCOI after my primary doctor recommended I see Dr. Jaime Hernandez| who is an orthopedic surgeon. He gave me complete confidence in a diagnosis to have a hip replacement. I am so happy I did this under his able hands and am now recovering with physical therapy. I appreciated the relationship I had with the doctor and his assistants.�,5
163,Paul M. Simic| MD,�As a result of many years of data entry| I have problems with trigger fingers. The pain was getting unbearable and my fingers were locking up constantly. At the suggestion of a cousin who is an RN| I made an appointment to see one of SCOI's hand specialists. My experience there was very pleasant and the doctor| PA| and staff were all very courteous| caring| and professional. Dr. Simic| who| in two visits| administered cortisone shots to get the swelling down| treated me. It has been a month since my last visit and I have a follow up appointment today| October 11th. So far| most of the pain has gone but in two fingers| I still have a problem with them locking up. Later| I will find out what the next step will be.�,5
164,Todd Shapiro| MD,�Two and a half years ago| Dr. Shapiro repaired a complete tear in my rotator cuff and in my biceps muscle. Now| my other shoulder has a partial tear. Dr. Shapiro seems to be right on in diagnosing and confirming with MRI| as well as first steps to take in treatment| which will be therapy first| timing of surgery is if needed| post-op therapy| etc. He explains things clearly and patiently answers all my questions.�,5
165,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�After having been told for more than 15 years that I did not need a hip replacement| I was referred to Dr. Hernandez by another SCOI doctor. Dr. Hernandez took one look at my x-rays and said I was in desperate need of a hip replacement. Although most people might be scared with this diagnosis| I was extremely relieved! FINALLY| there was hope for an end to the intense pain I had lived with for far too long!! My surgery was performed in the evening of July 19th| 2012 and I was home recovering early in the day on July 21. My pain was minimal and my recovery was swift! I was back at work as a 5th grade teacher on August 8th| just 20 days after my surgery! I never even had to use the pain pills that were prescribed. Words cannot convey how thankful I am to Dr. Hernandez for giving me my life back! Every day was a struggle for me to just do what I had to do. Now| I am back to hiking and am able to do everything I had been unable to do for so many years!�,5
166,Todd Shapiro| MD,�In March of 2009| my son was 2 1/2 years old. I fell in my house and broke my elbow. I had a hard time finding an orthopedist to treat me until I found Dr. Shapiro. Within 2 days of meeting him| he did surgery and cared for me until I was healed. Dr. Shapiro ended up to be the greatest blessing for me!�,5
167,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I had a hip replacement and everyone was very kind and helpful. Dr. Hernandez was a wonderful surgeon with a good follow up afterward. The nurses were also very good and took good care of me.�,5
168,Robert Gazmarian| MD,�Dr. Karzel saw me in consultation for an old injury resulting in my current problems with both knees. He referred me to Dr. Gazmarian for injections in an attempt to stave off what will be the inevitable knee replacements. I received a series of three injections of by Dr. Gazmarian| along with what remained of a six-week course of physical therapy. My knees are much improved to the point where I can walk up and down stairs without pain. I may experience relief for at least three months| hopefully longer.�,5
169,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�It was excellent from the beginning to end. Dr. Schamblin is an excellent surgeon. He is an awesome person and also has excellent bedside manners. Leslie is an excellent P.A. She is very kind and knowledgeable. They make a great team. Janelle and Edna are great team members also. They helped me from disability papers to getting refills of pain medication. I have recommended SCOI to many of my friends with orthopedic problems.�,5
170,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�I had an ACL replacement and my meniscus fixed. My visits to SCOI were informative and the staff and doctors were helpful. -- David R.�,5
171,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�This team gave me my life back. In nine months time| I had two total knee replacements. I was on crutches most of the time and in constant pain| even when I slept. I stopped working and couldn't play or babysit my grandchildren. In September| I was able to be with my 8 grandchildren at Lego land and get back to my favorite hobby| quilting. I've decided to retire. I turned 62 this summer and am looking forward to my first cruise through the Panama Canal. Thanks guys!!!! -- Barbara C.�,5
172,Todd Shapiro| MD,�I had an excellent experience at SCOI. I broke my leg in a skiing accident in Tahoe last February. They got me in to see Dr. Shapiro the next day. He immediately did x-rays and called for a CT Scan. As soon as I had the scan| he said it was too bad of a break and he needed to send me to the best in the west| a specialist at Cedar Sinai. I had a tibial plateau fracture. Apparently| one of the worst ones even the specialist had seen. All of the staff at SCOI is amazing and I was able to do follow up in town with Dr. Shapiro. The two doctors worked together so well. It was amazing to not have to drive back and forth to LA all the time with a leg that wasn't allowed to be bent for the first month after I broke it! ;) Thanks so much!�,5
173,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�I want to thank SCOI for their friendly staff. Dr. Hamilton| thank you for taking care of my shoulder. The rotator cuff surgery definitely fixed my aches and pains. Thank you again. Now I can go through the day without pain and sleep through the night.�,5

176,John L. Etcheverry| DPM,�Dr. Etcheverry and the whole staff at SCOI were terrific throughout this whole ordeal. This is the first broken bone I have had in my 62 years. They were very thorough and explained every thing| so I could understand what the procedure for this type of injury would be. Anna was a lifesaver to my wife. Not only did she help with all the Worker's Comp paperwork| but she arranged all the other doctor visits that were required. We went through a bit of stress when I found out I had to have an EKG and resulted in going to a heart specialist. She arranged all of this for us. All in all| this whole experience went very well and I am on the mend and back to work. Thank you SCOI for everything you all did to help me during all of this. I would readily recommend this facility to anyone who needed any type of orthopedic care. -- Lewis P.�,5
177,John L. Etcheverry| DPM,�Dr. Etcheverry is treating me for a recent left broken foot. I am also being treated for an old knee worker�s comp injury by Dr. Shapiro and his PA. Dr. Etcheverry and his staff have been a Godsend. They are professional| caring| and most importantly responsive to my needs no matter the degree. My experience with Dr. Shapiro albeit short given| has also been a good experience with no apparent frivolous delays. He is to the point with treatments and his staff knows what to do in his stead.�,5
178,David M. Auerbach| MD,�I had a great experience at SCOI. Dr. Auerbach made me feel very comfortable with the procedure and his staff was very professional. I would definitely recommend SCOI to friends and family. -- Hilary M.�,5

181,Robert Gazmarian| MD,�I went to Dr. Gazmarian first| to determine if there was anything I could do before resorting to surgery. He explained various treatment options and their effectiveness. He was thorough in explaining my injury and MRI results. He also had a positive attitude and linked me with Dr. Hanker to have surgery. Dr. Hanker was also thorough in explaining my injury as well as the surgery he performed. He spent time answering any questions I had| which was very reassuring! His assistant| Leyla was kind and knowledgeable and returned my phone calls promptly. I am happy with my surgery results and all the care I received by the physicians at SCOI. -- Aimee�,5
182,Patricia C. McKeever| MD,�My daughter badly bent the ligaments of her thumb at cheerleading practice. It was very painful.

Her assistant did a great job putting my daughter's arm in a cast to match her school colors. -- Gwen H.�,5
183,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Throughout my life| I have always been a very active person| participating in a variety of sports and at a younger age| at a relatively elite level. Sadly for me| some years back| after a couple of training-related falls| I found myself in quite a degree of skeletal pain| primarily in my left hip and leg. I did the usual route of rheumatologists| anti-inflammatory drugs| and painkillers| however| my condition deteriorated to a level where suddenly| I found myself walking with a cane| which to me| was not acceptable.The constant pain and lack of sleep was really getting me down| fortunately| I had an exceptional personal trainer| who along with keeping me physically fit| committed herself to getting me pain-free. I did not welcome the idea of hip replacement surgery. I eventually realized that it was the only solution to potentially eradicate my constant pain. My trainer told me that through her extensive Californian healthcare network| she would do research to find me the very best hip surgeon in Los Angeles. To this very day| I am convinced that she was 110% successful with her quest. She recommended Dr. Jaime Hernandez as the person who would fix my problems! From the moment I met Dr. Hernandez| I knew that he was the perfect surgeon to get me back| as close as possible| to my peak level of pain-free and cane-free fitness. The whole process from his preliminary detailed description of the surgical procedure| the actual procedure itself| and my wonderful post-operative nursing care was actually way better than I had actually hoped for. This attitude is reinforced with my regular follow up consultations with Dr. Hernandez and his wonderful team. I feel highly qualified| from a patient's perspective| to say that it doesn't get any better than this! One thing that I really must emphasize is that from the moment I awoke in post-op| I have really not had any pain whatsoever and I believe that this is truly remarkable| based upon where I was pain wise when I was admitted. Sometime in the future| I will most likely have my other hip replaced and frankly| I cannot begin to imagine having the procedure done by any surgeon other than the remarkable Dr. Jaime Hernandez. -- David G.�,5
184,David M. Auerbach| MD,�To my relief| Dr. Auerbach was attentive| knowledgeable| and informative. His manner was pleasant| and generous| relative to the surgical skills formally performed by a surgeon unrelated to the Southern California Orthopedic Institute. The staff was equally pleasant and efficient. I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Auerbach to friends and family| should they need his services and skills. -- JC E.�,5
185,Robert Gazmarian| MD,�I went to Dr. Gazmarian first| to determine if there was anything I could do before resorting to surgery. He explained various treatment options and their effectiveness. He was thorough in explaining my injury and MRI results. He also had a positive attitude and linked me with Dr. Hanker to have surgery. Dr. Hanker was also thorough in explaining my injury as well as the surgery he performed. He spent time answering any questions I had| which was very reassuring! His assistant| Leyla was kind and knowledgeable and returned my phone calls promptly. I am happy with my surgery results and all the care I received by the physicians at SCOI. -- Aimee�,5
186,Patricia C. McKeever| MD,�My daughter badly bent the ligaments of her thumb at cheerleading practice. It was very painful. Dr. McKeever saw her right away and was able to put my daughter's thumb back into place without a shot| in a matter of seconds. We were amazed and relieved! Her assistant did a great job putting my daughter's arm in a cast to match her school colors. -- Gwen H.�,5
187,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Throughout my life| I have always been a very active person| participating in a variety of sports and at a younger age| at a relatively elite level. Sadly for me| some years back| after a couple of training-related falls| I found myself in quite a degree of skeletal pain| primarily in my left hip and leg. I did the usual route of rheumatologists| anti-inflammatory drugs| and painkillers| however| my condition deteriorated to a level where suddenly| I found myself walking with a cane| which to me| was not acceptable.The constant pain and lack of sleep was really getting me down| fortunately| I had an exceptional personal trainer| who along with keeping me physically fit| committed herself to getting me pain-free. I did not welcome the idea of hip replacement surgery. I eventually realized that it was the only solution to potentially eradicate my constant pain. My trainer told me that through her extensive Californian healthcare network| she would do research to find me the very best hip surgeon in Los Angeles. To this very day| I am convinced that she was 110% successful with her quest. She recommended Dr. Jaime Hernandez as the person who would fix my problems! From the moment I met Dr. Hernandez| I knew that he was the perfect surgeon to get me back| as close as possible| to my peak level of pain-free and cane-free fitness. The whole process from his preliminary detailed description of the surgical procedure| the actual procedure itself| and my wonderful post-operative nursing care was actually way better than I had actually hoped for. This attitude is reinforced with my regular follow up consultations with Dr. Hernandez and his wonderful team. I feel highly qualified| from a patient's perspective| to say that it doesn't get any better than this! One thing that I really must emphasize is that from the moment I awoke in post-op| I have really not had any pain whatsoever and I believe that this is truly remarkable| based upon where I was pain wise when I was admitted. Sometime in the future| I will most likely have my other hip replaced and frankly| I cannot begin to imagine having the procedure done by any surgeon other than the remarkable Dr. Jaime Hernandez. -- David G.�,5
188,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�Dr. Jaivin changed my life by operating on my toe joint. I can walk miles without pain. My experience was top notch. I would recommend this surgical group highly to anybody who needs orthopedic help! -- Dean S.�,5
189,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�I was having pain on my left foot for a year. I went to a podiatrist| who did x-rays and a MRI and said that he couldn't find a problem. He said therefore| it was probably a weak peroneus tertius muscle or 5th tendon. He gave me a boot to wear for two weeks. Well| after five weeks of wearing it| the pain was still there. The pain was always with the first step after resting. For example| when I woke up| my first step out of bed was painful. If I sat on the couch for longer then five minutes| the pain would come when I started walking. Exercising was also painful. I thought that I would have to live with the pain for the rest of my life. My husband recommended Dr. Jaivin after he helped him with his foot. I went in and Dr. Jaivin said that he had seen a few cases like mine and had a high percentage of success rates with pain relief. Well| it took him five minutes to give me a cortisone shot in my foot. Immediately| I felt relief. I came in with pain and left pain free. That was two months ago. I wish I had gone a year ago when my husband first suggested him. I cannot thank him enough. -- Tamara K.�,5
190,Todd J. Molnar| MD,�I have been going to Dr. Molnar for 20 years| mostly for my back. However| when I have had other physical problems like my knee| I have consulted with him as well. I have always found him pleasant| thorough| and patient. I particularly like his support staff. Margret is absolutely amazing| taking excellent care of me| and making me feel like I count. Michael has been extremely accommodating in any of the paper work that I might need. They make me feel welcome and never as an inconvenience.�,5
191,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�Dr. Schamblin| in the Bakersfield office| did a shoulder cuff repair on both of my shoulders. He is an excellent surgeon. His P.A. Leslie is excellent. I recommend this office to anybody that has bone or joint problems.�,5
192,Todd J. Molnar| MD,�I have been going to Dr. Molnar for 20 years| mostly for my back. However| when I have had other physical problems like my knee| I have consulted with him as well.

Michael has been extremely accommodating in any of the paper work that I might need. They make me feel welcome and never as an inconvenience.�,5
193,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�Dr. Schamblin| in the Bakersfield office| did a shoulder cuff repair on both of my shoulders. He is an excellent surgeon. His P.A. Leslie is excellent. I recommend this office to anybody that has bone or joint problems.�,5
194,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�My shoulder was causing constant pain and sleepless nights. Dr. Getelman operated on my shoulder and I now have no pain and am sleeping fine. I am very grateful to Dr. Getelman and his staff. God bless each and every one if them! -- Mark M.�,5
195,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I had severe arthritis in both shoulders and I couldn't lift my arms more than half way up. Dr. Guanche did a total replacement of both shoulders. He was fantastic| explained that I could have my life back and be pain free for the first time in 20 years. He talked me through everything and set my mind at ease before the surgery and has been great about helping me recover after. -- JP H.�,5
196,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I had surgery in June 2013 to repair my ACL in my left knee. Dr. Getelman did an awesome job and the surgery went smoothly. He recorded the surgery for me and I received a DVD of the experience. My physical therapy went well and I am glad I had this surgery done. I love to snow ski and I have the full use of my knee back now. I also want to mention that a donor graft was used to replace my torn ACL. Because of this| my incisions were minimal and the scars left are barely noticeable. I am very pleased with the outcome and Dr. Getelman and his staff are the best!�,5
197,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I have had a total reverse shoulder replacement by Dr. Guanche. I then went through rehabilitation at SCOI after surgery and cannot say enough about how impressed I am by their professionalism and personal| caring attitude toward each patient. I had no pain and was treated with dignity. I was taught what to do upon returning home after extensive physical therapy. The knowledge I gained at SCOI has allowed me to lead a pain-free life and I can now physically do things that I could only dream of before. I recommend SCOI to any and all who are looking for the perfect orthopedic experience. -- Donna P.�,5
198,John L. Etcheverry| DPM,�I broke my right ankle in 1998| in multiple places playing football. The result was nine screws and a plate. In 2012| I decided it was time to remove the hardware| based on minimal problems I was having. Dr. Schamblin removed my hardware. He was the third doctor over the past 15 years to advise of the removal| but the only doctor that made me feel comfortable and confident in doing so. In April 2012| I had my hardware removed. In May 2012| I had an infection and reaction to the stitches and had to go back to surgery. Dr. Schamblin and his staff were wonderful through both procedures. In July| I was still having some of the same problems with pain and mobility. Dr. Schamblin did not give up. In fact| he referred me to Dr. Etcheverry| who is ankle specific. Dr. Etcheverry cleaned out my ankle in August 2012 and because of that surgery| I have regained mobility that I lost 15 years ago. I was never in a rush to make any decision and both doctors never left me any doubt that each decision with them and SCOI was the right decision for me. I will always recommend SCOI and my two doctors to anyone needing medical advice or treatment.�,5
199,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�Dr. Getelman did a right knee medial meniscus clean up in late September 2012 of a nasty tear. By mid-November| after six weeks of physical therapy| my knee is great and I'm back to normal| working out five or six days a week and playing golf.�,5
200,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�As a 19 year old| I used to think I was invincible from the world of injuries. Until I sustained a knee injury that was severe enough to sideline me for quite some time. Having a knee injury that was slightly out of the norm| I am so glad that I chose to come to SCOI. Dr. Burns walked through a 2-year process with me as we got me back on track and playing the sport that I love. He communicated in a way that I could understand and even through a long process with a couple of surgeries tacked on I can honestly say he is the reason why I went back to play volleyball and start training for my first half marathon. With his positive attitude I was able to maintain my positive attitude| making the process that much smoother. But with my luck| I also sustained another injury| this time on my other knee. Having moved out of the Northridge/Van Nuys area and into the Conejo Valley area| I knew that SCOI would have physicians that I could trust. Dr. Bahk guided me through the process and it was a piece of cake. I felt comfortable about his decisions and game plan going into surgery. And almost 5 months later| I am getting closer and closer to being able to do the things I love| maintaining an active lifestyle that a now 23 year old should have. Thank you SCOI for helping me along the way!�,5
201,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�My knees hate me| plain and simple. At 24| I'm preparing myself for my 7th new surgery| and by god| this had better be my last. At age 13| my knees starting dislocating for no rhyme or reason| just out of the socket they would go. I was living in Oregon at the time and had my first two surgeries there| one on the right and one on the left. Mistake! My muscles are too stretchy and they did a lateral release on both. Dr. Richard Ferkel has treated my father since he was my current age and it was the most logical step in mind to go in and get a second opinion from the man| the myth| the legend| as soon as I moved back to California. The process of surgeries 3-5 began. I'm a martial artist. So keeping strong and healthy is critical for me to be able to learn and as an instructor at my studio| to teach as well. After two years of recovery and constant rehab for surgery number five| my third on my right knee| I became as active as I have ever been and boy did it feel amazing! This last August| I started feeling pain again in my left knee| just what I needed. Mrs. Natalie is a god let me tell you. I called her up| got in right away for an x-ray| and discovered I had a new friend in my knee in the form of a half-inch bone chip. So the process for surgery six began. I was back at my karate studio the day of surgery| wrapped up and on Advil| getting my new belt. I then spent several weeks rehabbing before getting back on the mat to train for my next level. The real bummer came to be. At the very start of this New Year| I was in a sparring class| giving it my all| then a lunge| pop| and fall took me down. There went my ACL| and consequently| there went my sanity. That was possibly the hardest doctors appointment I've ever had to go through| to have to hear that my dreams and goals have to once again be put on hold so that my body can be repaired. I lost it| legitimately lost it. But because SCOI and Dr. Ferkel�s team is like a second family to me| I've been able to start pushing through my own sadness to see the bigger goal. So| here I am now before surgery seven| teaching every day until surgery because training isn't an option and doing my best to keep my head in the game. Through injury we| or at least I have learned to take a step back to examine what it is I am doing as what it is I CAN do to keep myself happy and safe. Through the blood| sweat| and tears| I don't think I would change a thing that I have been through| other than maybe being blessed with better knees at birth. It has made me stronger and dare I say more patient to boot. I have hardware that can make me beep in metal detectors| I have scars that each have their own story| and I have a family at SCOI that I cherish. Look forward| never back| and set your goals. Let SCOI help you do all that. It is worth all your time and effort to get the absolute best care possible and you'll find it there.�,5
202,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�Thank you for being such a personable| compassionate surgeon. My shoulder problems plagued me for two years and I had seen three other doctors. When I came in to see you for a consultation| you put me at ease right away. You have a great personality that is genuinely warm and caring. It is great to have a skilled surgeon but one that is truly caring is very special! Thanks for listening| and thanks for taking the time to explain what to expect. I also appreciated the video with your explanation during my surgery. Many thanks for your excellent skills| attentiveness| care| and concern. I'm not looking forward to any surgery soon however| if I need a surgeon| I know where I will go for excellent care. Also I would like to praise Erika for her attention to detail. She was always on top of everything. I have been very satisfied with the care I have received from you.�,5
203,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�This is a great facility from the surgery to the physical therapy. You guys are the best and have wonderful doctors. I really enjoyed physical therapy. They really know what they are doing. The facility is clean and parking is good.�,5
204,David M. Auerbach| MD,�I saw Dr. Auerbach recently for the first time| for problems with my shoulder| elbow| a trigger finger problem| and inflammation near my thumb. I found him to be a rare gem of a doctor. He is wonderfully caring| gentle| kind| exceptionally knowledgeable| and professional. He made me feel like he really honestly cared about the wellbeing and health of his patients. He did not rush through my office visit| like how other typical doctors rush through office visits| and he was very calm and centered| letting me ask questions. He answered those questions with great patience and clarity. I like to be involved in my own health treatments and options| and he was wonderful and explained to me my options for treatment| which were either steroid injections or wraps to wear on my elbow and hand/thumb area. I chose to go with the wraps and they have helped me tremendously. I had an entirely wonderful experience with him as my doctor. I trust him fully and would definitely go to him again| if I have any return of symptoms. I entirely recommend him to anyone who wants a doctor who they can trust fully and who really| truly cares for his patients.�,5
205,Brian S. Grossman| MD,�I wanted to thank Dr. Grossman and his staff for once again helping me be able to live my life to the fullest by repairing my lumbar issues. I immediately felt relief after the surgery and continued to heal quickly from the surgery. Him and has staff are amazing at making you know you are being cared for and they use the latest and greatest technology to make the surgery the least invasive it can be to get you back living life quickly. Thank you gain Dr. Grossman and staff. You have made a world of difference to me and my family in helping me. You guys are truly amazing!�,5
206,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I waited 14 years to have surgery| and finding the right combination of doctor and surgical approach was the most important factor in deciding to proceed in treating my aching back. Dr. Barcohana explained the approach he would take| was thorough in presenting the pros and cons of the approach| and put my fears to rest when talking about the results of the procedure. From diagnosis through surgery and now physical therapy| it�s been a seamless experience. At ten weeks| I have no pain| and the recovery has been much| much quicker than I expected. Thanks ever so much to the staff of SCOI and thank you Dr. Barcohana for your expertise and giving me my life back.�,5
207,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�I had surgery on my right ankle. He was very professional and thorough in explaining all of my options. The entire staff is very friendly and caring. They are gentle in handling the affected areas and explain all steps of the healing process. You never wonder what will happen next because all steps are described from the beginning.�,5
208,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I was a 56-year-old male who enjoyed all outdoor activities| but had been experiencing pain in my left hip for about a year. I always thought it would just go away and tried to ignore it. In September of 2011| I was on a 15 mile hike in Yosemite and was having trouble keeping up with the boys. I had always been the leader and finally admitted to myself I had a problem. After returning from that camping trip| I made an appointment to see Dr. Jaime Hernandez at SCOI in Van Nuys| California. He asked me a few questions and took a few X-Rays. His diagnosis was a hip replacement. I made an appointment for surgery and on February 13| 2012. Dr. Hernandez performed the most perfect hip replacement procedure anyone could ask for. I was walking the day after surgery and riding my mountain bike 20 miles within a month. It was an easy procedure to recover from| and with therapy and the guidance of Dr. Hernandez| I was back to a full and active life within 7 weeks of the surgery. Looking back| I can only ask myself| Why did I wait so long to seek help? This summer I went bike riding| body surfing| hiking| swimming in Hawaii| and played tennis as if I was 20 years old all over again. All I can say is THANK YOU| THANK YOU| THANK YOU to Dr. Hernandez and the SCOI team. -- Donald G.�,5
209,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�My son| who is 14| had a broken toe and was seen by Dr. Jaivin. Dr. Jaivin doesn't usually take patients under 16| but lucky for us| he took my son. Dr. Jaivin has such a great bedside manner| and treated my son like a young adult. We had a very good experience and would recommend him to everyone!�,5
210,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�What a great experience from all doctors� staff from the receptionist| nurse| X-ray and check out. Everyone treated me in a professional and friendly manner.�,5
211,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�SCOI is an amazing facility and I am so glad it's here in Santa Clarita| where I live. It's nice to be able to go to one place for your doctors| x-rays| MRIs and physical therapy. Dr. Karzel and his staff are great! Dr. Karzel has done all my surgeries including| a right shoulder and double knee surgeries. Everything went as planned. I completed my physical therapy and am back to waterskiing and working out on a regular basis!�,5
212,Todd J. Molnar| MD,�In the last week of coaching my youth football team to a Super Bowl| I was dealing with an old problem| a ruptured disk # 6&7 (pain in the neck literally). Then I fractured my heel during football. I was really worried I would not be able to coach my team in the big game| so I immediately went in to see Dr. Molnar. He patched me up so I could finish coaching the last week of the season. Now after a spinal procedure and a walking boot I should be back in the gym in a couple weeks. Thanks Dr. Molnar| you are the man.�,5
213,Todd J. Molnar| MD,�In November of 2013| I developed back and leg pains and returned to Dr. Molnar after several years of improvement. As in the past| Dr. Molnar and his staff were very sensitive to my pain and discomfort| caused by Scoliosis and herniated discs (now 3). They began to assess the condition| which included x-rays and a MRI to determine the root cause. As a result of this| Dr. Molnar determined that an epidural injection would help with the pain caused by deterioration of my spine. The treatment was followed by a visit to Brian| who explained that Dr. Molnar wanted me to have physical therapy. I chose the SCOI Rehab Center because I had a very positive experience several years ago. The principal physical therapist| Jessica| very ably assessed my condition. The therapy treatments began with much success| as I already feel the improvement. I'm very thankful to Dr. Molnar| Brian| the entire staff| and Jessica and her Team. I have always highly recommended SCOI to friends| colleagues| and even clients. I must add that the reception staff is very courteous and helpful. I am looking forward to getting back to where I was before my crisis occurred and to hopefully return to my Pilates sessions. Thanks for all you do!�,5
214,A. Elizabeth Bloz�| MD,�When I first met Dr. Bloze I could barely carry on with the simplest of tasks. I was crooked and the pain was off the charts. Despite other doctors saying that surgery was the only way Dr. Bloze kept me away from the knife. She is a hero of mine. She is everything a doctor should be. Approachable| understanding| caring...I could go on for days. I am truly blessed and extremely lucky that I found Dr. Bloze and SCOI. To this day I am surgery free.�,5
215,A. Elizabeth Bloz�| MD,�I love SCOI! As a middle-aged active woman| SCOI is my go-to place for all my aches and injuries. Dr. Karzel performed shoulder surgery on my in 2010 and I'm pain free and have nearly my full range of motion| and it's such that I don't notice a difference between shoulders. Dr. Lynch performed carpal tunnel surgery 2009 and no more pain| numbness or tingling! Dr. Bloze is currently helping me with a herniated disk and she is knowledgeable and a great listener. Two of my athletic kids have also seen Dr. Karzel (for ACL surgery) and Dr. Lynch for several fractured digits. SCOI in Valencia is close by and I'm so happy for all the great doctors and staff there! Thank you!�,5
216,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�My total knee replacement in April 2012 went very smoothly and the pain post-operatively was very minimal. Dr Hernandez and his staff are very professional and personable| plus he has a good sense of humor. I would most definitely return to him| if I ever needed further joint replacement. Highly recommended.�,1
217,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I had hip replacement surgery seven months ago and Dr. Hernandez was brilliant and very kind. I will be having my other hip done this year.�,5
218,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I am looking forward to Dr. Hernandez replacing my other hip. He did a great job on the first one. -- James P.�,5
219,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I was referred to Southern California Orthopedic Institute by a friend and doctor and I have been very happy with the treatment and professionalism so far! I fractured my arm right before New Years and they were kind enough to see me on New Years Eve Day. Dr. Bahk and his staff have been very nice and treated me very well. I really appreciate their genuine concern for my well-being and would highly recommend them to anyone needing orthopedic services!�,5
220,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�I have had two surgeries at SCOI| and my son had one surgery there. There is no other place I would recommend surgeries to friends and family. The thoughtfulness and kindness shared by all whom I came in contact with at the surgical site was very much appreciated. Surgery is a far less scary and stressful experience at SCOI. Thank you| Dr. Karzel| staff| and employees at the Van Nuys surgical center for all of your support| warmth| and tender hands. I am ever so grateful to you all.�,5
221,David M. Auerbach| MD,�I broke my humorus at work on March 3| 2013. Because it was a workers comp case| I was not able to choose the doctor. I had a bad experience with the first doctor they assigned to me. But here at SCOI| I feel as though I have won the lottery. The care I have received here had been first rate. I appreciate the professionalism and kindness of all the people at SCOI.�,5
222,Brian S. Grossman| MD,�I am an RN in the prison system. I fell and broke my back. When Dr. Grossman saw my MRI| he said| I needed surgery. I responded that back surgery doesn't do well. He told me when there is an isolated problem people do very well. I was trying to be the good employee| so I didn't have surgery very quickly but finally couldn't stand the pain any longer. Being a nurse that took care of way too many back surgery re-dos| I was scared to death that the surgery wouldn't be a success. But I woke up in recovery room with my leg pain completely gone. My surgery was in 2009 and to this day| I consider it a great success. I was VERY happy with Dr. Grossman and the entire SCOI organization. I recommend SCOI to everyone!�,5
223,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�All I have to say is that Dr. Karzel did a fantastic job on my ACL/meniscus knee surgery. I had an unstable knee and with the surgery I believe I will be back to my old self| if not better even. It was unbelievable| surgery went terrific| I had no pain whatsoever after the surgery. Two weeks after the surgery I was off crutches and brace| and now a little over a month I am almost walking without a limp and feeling very well. Dr. Karzel did an amazing job and I am so grateful.�,5
224,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�Dr. Hamilton is my hero! In July of 2012 I had surgery on my left shoulder hoping that the pain I was having would go away. IT is because of Dr. Hamilton that I no longer have that terrible pain that prevented me from playing golf or doing yard work. I can now swing my golf clubs without any fear of pain. I'm striking the golf ball much better and I plan on shooting in the low 80s this summer. Thanks Dr. Hamilton!�,5
225,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�My total knee replacement in April 2012 went very smoothly and the pain post-operatively was very minimal. Dr Hernandez and his staff are very professional and personable| plus he has a good sense of humor. I would most definitely return to him| if I ever needed further joint replacement. Highly recommended.�,5
226,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�I came to Southern California Orthopedic Institute for knee surgery| a torn meniscus and arthritis. I was given kind and thoughtful care for my surgery. The procedures were explained to me in detail including risk and expected benefits from the surgery. The surgery went well and the follow-up care has been fabulous. I would recommend the doctors| PAs| and friendly staff to anyone seeking orthopedic treatment. Honestly I felt like I was treated like family.�,5
227,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I was pretty shocked when I had my first appointment elsewhere to discover I needed double arthroscopic hip surgery. I decided to go for a second opinion and came across Dr. Carlos Guanche. From our first meeting| I felt so comfortable and secure with what he had to say. Not to mention his next appointment wasn't for three weeks| which is actually a good sign| seeing he is a super busy doctor. I've never had a serious surgery like this| so I tried to just think positive. I can honestly say for having surgery| it was the easiest experience of my life. I felt very confident with Dr. Guanche and after the first surgery| I was up moving around like there was nothing wrong the next day. My friends were really shocked I looked and felt so great. My ONLY issue was same day of surgery trying to figure out how to sit down and use the restroom. The second surgery I had that figured out so it wasn't as bad. I don't know if I just won the surgery lottery but I couldn't have asked for a better experience from pre-opt| post-opt| all the office help| dealing with me calling all the time about disability and my rehab| which wasn't affiliated with SCOI. My best advice is think positively. Tomorrow is my FINAL follow up on my second hip and I can't believe it's all already done. Thinking back to hearing I needed it done made me think it was going to be the longest and worst experience ever| but it really wasn't. I could go on for days about my experience to be honest but eventually| you'll just have to dive in and go for it and trust Dr Guanche because he is amazing. Thanks for everything. Looking forward to getting back to triathlons as soon as possible! -- Danielle M.�,5
228,Trevor P. Lynch| MD| FACS,�There was complete thoroughness throughout treatment. There was attention to detail without any snags; from billing| office visits| follow-ups| and physical therapy| I'm completely satisfied and my health problem fixed! -- J. K.�,5
229,William H. Mouradian| MD,�Dr. Mouradian explains everything for my procedure extremely well. There were very few questions for me to ask. He's excellent!�,5
230,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�I had a bad experience with a doctor on my first shoulder surgery. Dr. Schamblin performed a second surgery and gave me much more movement in my shoulder. Dr. Schamblin was great at explaining the treatment and therapy I was receiving. My first doctor did not explain very much to me as well as a bad surgery experience. I'm really happy with your facility and all the staff. I would recommend your facility to anyone and have already been doing so. -- Troy F.�,5
231,Steven A. Schopler| MD,�Four years ago| I began experiencing a horrible pain in my leg. It began with my calf muscle seizing up and then moved into severe knee pain. At that point| my knee would make popping and clicking noises as well as give out for no reason. For two years| I was sent all over the state of California| seeing different doctors: orthopedics| neurologists| neurosurgeons| chiropractors| message therapists| physical therapists| and then eventually I found my way to Dr. Schopler at SCOI. At first glance| he indicated I had a bulging disc at the L5/S1 level. It didn't seem to be doing much harm and thought with a little time| it would ease and go away. We agreed to try an epidural injection to try to ease some of the pain. It seemed to do the trick for about six months. After that| it was back with a vengeance. I waited another six months before I went back and told him I just couldn't take it anymore. At that time| he said we could try a nerve block and see if it gave any response. Sure enough| it told us everything we needed to know. In February of 2013| I had a microdiscectomy to remove the bulge. It was immediate relief! Now| one year later| I am working out with a personal trainer| two days a week| running about 10 to 15 miles a week| and walking another 10 to 15 miles. Thankfully| Dr. Schopler did not give up on me and was able to help get my active life style back for me!�,5
232,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I had a fall a few years ago that resulted in a labral tear in my left hip. I had surgery on it in New York and while I experienced some improvement| I continued to experience a lot of pain| weakness and inflammation. Despite physical therapy| acupuncture| and steroid injections| I was not able to resume normal activities including bicycling| walking| and swimming. After moving to California| I came to see Dr. Guanche who was determined that I needed further surgery. I am now at the 6-week post surgical mark and while still going slowly| I feel better than I have in years. The recovery has been remarkably easier. Some examples of which are: the first time I was told to stay in bed for two weeks and use a passive motion machine during that time| this time I was up and moving around the next day; the first time I took prescription pain meds and antibiotics and anti-inflammatories post surgery which I developed complications from| this time I took only some Advil and was fine. The surgical facilities were wonderfully laid out| clean and bright| with a calm atmosphere and kind staff; a real contrast to the hospital experience the first time around. I would definitely use SCOI again as well as recommend Dr. Guanche and the facility to others. And I am buying a new bike tomorrow :)�,5
233,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�I came to Southern California Orthopedic Institute for knee surgery| a torn meniscus and arthritis. I was given kind and thoughtful care for my surgery. The procedures were explained to me in detail including risk and expected benefits from the surgery. The surgery went well and the follow-up care has been fabulous. I would recommend the doctors| PAs| and friendly staff to anyone seeking orthopedic treatment. Honestly I felt like I was treated like family.�,5
234,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I was pretty shocked when I had my first appointment elsewhere to discover I needed double arthroscopic hip surgery. I decided to go for a second opinion and came across Dr. Carlos Guanche. From our first meeting| I felt so comfortable and secure with what he had to say. Not to mention his next appointment wasn't for three weeks| which is actually a good sign| seeing he is a super busy doctor. I've never had a serious surgery like this| so I tried to just think positive. I can honestly say for having surgery| it was the easiest experience of my life. I felt very confident with Dr. Guanche and after the first surgery| I was up moving around like there was nothing wrong the next day. My friends were really shocked I looked and felt so great. My ONLY issue was same day of surgery trying to figure out how to sit down and use the restroom. The second surgery I had that figured out so it wasn't as bad. I don't know if I just won the surgery lottery but I couldn't have asked for a better experience from pre-opt| post-opt| all the office help| dealing with me calling all the time about disability and my rehab| which wasn't affiliated with SCOI. My best advice is think positively. Tomorrow is my FINAL follow up on my second hip and I can't believe it's all already done. Thinking back to hearing I needed it done made me think it was going to be the longest and worst experience ever| but it really wasn't. I could go on for days about my experience to be honest but eventually| you'll just have to dive in and go for it and trust Dr Guanche because he is amazing. Thanks for everything. Looking forward to getting back to triathlons as soon as possible! -- Danielle M.�,5
235,Trevor P. Lynch| MD| FACS,�There was complete thoroughness throughout treatment. There was attention to detail without any snags; from billing| office visits| follow-ups| and physical therapy| I'm completely satisfied and my health problem fixed! -- J. K.�,5
236,William H. Mouradian| MD,�Dr. Mouradian explains everything for my procedure extremely well. There were very few questions for me to ask. He's excellent!�,5
237,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�I had a bad experience with a doctor on my first shoulder surgery. Dr. Schamblin performed a second surgery and gave me much more movement in my shoulder. Dr. Schamblin was great at explaining the treatment and therapy I was receiving. My first doctor did not explain very much to me as well as a bad surgery experience. I'm really happy with your facility and all the staff. I would recommend your facility to anyone and have already been doing so. -- Troy F.�,5
238,Steven A. Schopler| MD,�Four years ago| I began experiencing a horrible pain in my leg. It began with my calf muscle seizing up and then moved into severe knee pain. At that point| my knee would make popping and clicking noises as well as give out for no reason. For two years| I was sent all over the state of California| seeing different doctors: orthopedics| neurologists| neurosurgeons| chiropractors| message therapists| physical therapists| and then eventually I found my way to Dr. Schopler at SCOI. At first glance| he indicated I had a bulging disc at the L5/S1 level. It didn't seem to be doing much harm and thought with a little time| it would ease and go away. We agreed to try an epidural injection to try to ease some of the pain. It seemed to do the trick for about six months. After that| it was back with a vengeance.

239,Steven A. Schopler| MD,�My experience with SCOI was and continues to be wonderful. Dr. Schopler and his team are amazing. Melissa is so highly organized and thorough| I really appreciate that. Shelly and Sabrina were great with all of my insurance questions and needs. Dr. Schopler is nothing less than outstanding. From the moment I met him I felt that I was in the best hands for my situation. He worked hard to get my surgery scheduled so my pain would go away. He was cheerful in the pre-op area| which put me at ease and was there in the hospital to check up on me. He was and continues to be encouraging and helpful with my recovery. SCOI is an amazing place and I am very thankful for the office in Bakersfield. -- Ruth E.�,5
240,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�After years of pain and limping| I had Dr. Jaivin operate on my plantar ligament in my right foot. I tried everything: B-12 shots| new shoes| stop running| cortisone shots. Nothing brought permanent relief. Until Dr. Jaivin operated| my foot hurt with every step| every time| every day. The relief from the surgery was immediate and continues to improve as the foot stretches. I see a time when I may begin jogging again. Thanks Dr. Jaivin and SCOI! -- Glen H.�,5
241,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�My wife and I have used SCOI several times with great success. My wife went for foot and hand issues. I had a knee issue and both shoulders operated on by Dr. Karzel. Most recent was my left shoulder with extensive muscle and rotator cuff damage. Aside from going into great detail about what needed to be done| Dr. Karzel made certain that I understood the surgery process| start to finish| recovery| and rehabilitation. What impresses me the most though is that in a day| when people are looking for any reason to sue a doctor and blame them for anything that may go wrong| Dr. Karzel supplies you with a video of the procedure. Pretty confidant if you ask me! Very professional outfit and we are pleased with the results!!�,5
242,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�I have been a stuntwoman in the motion picture business for over 30 years. Dr. Karzel has put me back together after injuries at work and from accumulative injuries. I also am a Gold Card Member of the Woman's Professional Rodeo Association and run barrels and team rope at professional rodeos. I am the Woman's Professional Rodeo Association California Circuit Director and with out your sports medicine| SCOI| I would not be able to be competing at a Pro Level as a Pro Athlete at 53 years of age. I thank you for all of your help.�,5
243,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�After discovering that I had tore my right ACL in October| I knew that I would be returning to SCOI| specifically to see Dr. Getelman. Eight years ago| I had tore my left ACL playing soccer. I recovered fully and since then I have completed three marathons| taken up cycling| and played in many soccer and basketball tournaments and leagues. Eight years ago| I told Dr. Getelman that I had aspirations of climbing Mt. Whitney five months after my surgery and unlike other doctors who discouraged me| he told me it could happen if I put the work into my recovery. This time there is a marathon four months after surgery and once again| I am confident that I will be completing it. My mother| an avid marathoner| has also been treated by Dr. Getelman. Between the two of us| he has performed eight surgeries| so that we can have the active quality of life we enjoy. A testament to his skill and that of SCOI| this year I will be joining my mother in the LA Marathon. -- Michelle S.�,5

248,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�It's been two years now since I had my left hip replaced by Dr. Hernandez and I couldn't be more satisfied. Within a month after the surgery| I was riding my mountain bike as if the surgery had never occurred. This was definitely the easiest surgery to recover from that I have ever had and now| two years later| I still fill fine.

249,John L. Etcheverry| DPM,�I am very happy with the results of my surgery. I had foot reconstruction surgery of left foot| fusing three joints and lengthening of Achilles tendon as the result of fallen arches. Five months later| when I walk| there is little-to-no pain. The foot that didn't have the surgery is more painful than the one that was operated on. I am hoping to have surgery later this year. -- Pam S.�,5
250,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�For a crummy experience it was a very positive experience. Dr. Jaivin was extremely caring and gave my husband and myself an amazing feeling of security. He was gentle| confident| and imparted his knowledge to us. -- Berte B.�,5
251,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�Dr. Snyder and SCOI were very professional and took great care to ensure the success of my surgery and recovery post operation. The surgery was top notch and caring| the care by the SCOI staff has always been above average. I had a very traumatic tear in my shoulder and truly believe that without SCOI's help| I would never be able to have full use of my shoulder. I am now on the road to recovery and all the pain is gone! I can't wait to play golf again and completely believe it's possible thanks to Dr. Snyder and SCOI. -- Shawn W.�,5

253,Todd J. Molnar| MD,�My wife was experiencing severe pain in her back and leg. She could not sit or walk. After visiting a few Chiropractors| and Urgent care| she still had intense pain. It was a late Friday about 3:00 pm when I called the Southern California Orthopedic Institute for an appointment. To my surprise| they said bring her in immediately. From that time on| she was scheduled for an MRI and X-Rays. She was diagnosed as having a ruptured Disc. She was subsequently treated and is on her way to recovery. Today she is able to walk| and sit with very little pain. My wife and I are thankful for the quick action and treatment by Dr. Molnar and his Assistant Brian Lusgarten. All I can add is that they cared and are a credit to their profession. We are thankful for SCOI and the excellent treatment by Dr. Molnar and his assistant. -- John M.�,5
254,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I had rotator cuff surgery done 13 months ago by Dr. Getelman. The pain I had prior to the surgery is completely gone. I'm back to my swimming workouts at 100%. Dr. Getelman and his staff was terrific and if I ever needed work done again| I'd certainly have him do it.�,5
255,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I came in and met Dr. Getelman after I experienced a fall at work. I twisted my knee and had a great amount of pain. I was always active and to have an injury slow me down| was nothing less then devastation to me. I enjoy running| hiking| boating| and off roading| so much that I require two good knees! Dr. Getelman recommended ACL reconstructive surgery| using cadaver tissue. I was a bit reluctant at first| but after his and Stacie's explanation of the surgery and the recovery necessary| I went ahead with the procedure. Well| a year and half later| I have completed two half marathons and looking forward to a third half marathon just before my 50th birthday. I am thrilled with my outcome and am so very thankful for Dr. Getelman and Stacie for their expertise and care they gave to me to continue to enjoy my active life. Thank you to all at SCOI.�,5

257,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�In 2004 Dr. Hamilton performed rotator cuff surgery on my left shoulder. After having a successful surgery I begin to heavily involve myself in weight training. I actually set record in the bench press for my weight class and the Police Olympics. Fast-forward to June of 2011| well doing dumbbell incline flies I felt a pop in my left shoulder. I tried to work through the injury| but I knew something was wrong. I saw Dr. Hamilton again and he said I tore the rotator cuff after viewing the MRI. Once again I had surgery on January 6| 2012. I am recovering right now and I am optimistic my shoulder once again be a strong as ever. I have all the confidence in Dr. Hamilton and his procedures and if anything else happens I would not hesitate to return to him. -- Christopher S.�,5
258,Babak Barcohana| MD,�One year ago| I was experiencing debilitating pain and I was unable to walk more than a few steps at a time. I could not stand up straight.

263,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�First of all I would like to complement Dr. Snyder on being a great doctor with great bedside manner. The facility is totally awesome. The staff is friendly and always willing to help you. The SCOI center is very efficient| they never had me sitting around waiting. Thank you Dr. Snyder for all your great work.

266,Richard J. Spelts| DO| FAAFP,�Like most active seniors| I have been endowed with osteoarthritis of the knees| in spite of a healthy diet| no smoking| moderate drinking and regular exercise. They say osteoarthritis is just an inherent part of the Golden Years of life. I have found it to be a persistent poaching of pleasure| by limiting all activity involving the knees. What a pleasure to have discovered Southern California Orthopedic Institute and Dr. Spelts! Him and his staff have been attentive to my needs| generous with the time spent listening and proposing alternate solutions| and painless in the performance of the resolution to the issue. The normal intention of the waiting room| has lost it's meaning at SCOI because appointment times are observantly kept. My experience here has given me every expectation of extending the serviceability of my knees for many years to come| enjoying life to its fullest| thanks to these medical professionals!�,5
267,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�I had a horrible right shoulder rotator cuff injury when I saw Dr. Hamilton. I could barely lift my arm at or above shoulder level and I had searing pain with any sudden movement of my shoulder. I needed to have surgery. I told Dr. Hamilton that I wanted to be able to play tennis and engage in the other recreational activities I engaged in before my injury. He told me that he would do his best to repair the damage and that with some hard work during rehabilitation and a little luck I would have a shot at it. Although the surgery was a little more extensive than what Dr. Hamilton had anticipated| I had a successful outcome and I worked long and hard in rehabilitating my shoulder. Since then| I have been able to play tennis| softball| swim| and engage in moderate weight lifting at the gym without any difficulties. More importantly| as long as I maintain my regular exercise and stretching routine| my shoulder has been virtually pain free. Thank you Dr. Hamilton.�,5
268,A. Elizabeth Bloz�| MD,�I am a frequent flyer at SCOI! :-) After spending many years and visiting a variety of doctors to identify what was causing extreme pain and frequent falling| Dr. Bloze knew just what tests were needed to give an accurate diagnosis that led me on my journey to better health. While I did not like the diagnosis| I very much liked the care| concern| and direction she gave and continues to give in guiding me. My first visit was five years ago and SCOI is the first place I call when my body needs care| which has been often! In those five years since my initial visit| I have broken eight bones| all of which SCOI doctors have treated. I strongly believe I would not have the abilities I do without the quality of care given.�,5
269,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I had terrible pain in my right knee| which was adversely impacting my lifestyle and even deprived me of sleep. Dr. Bahk operated on me and repaired my torn meniscus and removed a lot of calcified crystals. I subsequently developed a sack of fluid on the back of my knee which made walking uncomfortable. Dr. Bahk drained the fluid and made me feel much better and I can walk normally again. It's been only 19 days since the surgery and I'm back to doing all my normal activities including a rigorous program of physical fitness. Dr. Back is a wonderful doctor with a friendly manner and an excellent medical education.�,5
270,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�In October I had surgery on my foot due to a Mortons Neuroma. I had previously tried cortisone shots and a boot with no improvement. Once I decided to have surgery everything moved along very smoothly. I had the surgery at the SCOI surgical center. The care I got was wonderful. The surgical center called me the next day to check up on me. Dr. Jaivin was very patient and explained everything to me prior to surgery. H followed me for approximately six weeks of post op care. I could not have been any happier with him. He is a gem.�,5
271,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I received a second procedure with Dr. Bahk and I am extremely satisfied with him and his staff. I have already referred him to a friend and a family member. Him and his staff are first rate.�,5

275,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�When I ruptured my lower bicep tendon at work as a firefighter| I immediately thought how was I going to find the best doctor to repair the tendon and get me back to my career. I was a sports chiropractor for 12 years and I had patients that went to SCOI. I also knew I would have to convince my employer to let me choose the doctor. Let me save you the trouble. I did all the research| read many bios of doctors| and knew exactly the type of doctor that I wanted for my own surgery. Now it was my turn as the doctor to find the right doctor. Many things can go wrong| but you will have to trust me on this one. Dr. Bahk will tell you exactly what to expect. He will not rush you. He is very professional and extremely smart. His bedside manner is exactly how I would treat my own patients. The recovery is what it is. He does the initial hard work and then you listen and do the rehab| which is also hard work. My job is very physical. I was back to work at 90%| 7 months later. At one year| I was at 100%. Dr. Bahk is very good at what he does. I hope this helps anyone who has any fears or doubts. Thank You Doctor Bahk! -- Brian P.�,5
276,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�Dr. Karzel is the best! After a year and a half since my shoulder surgery| I do not even remember having it unless someone asks about it. The scars are almost invisible and I am able to work out and enjoy any activity. It�s with my deepest gratitude to Dr. Karzel for my strength and well-being. His staff is also wonderful and caring. SCOI is the only place I recommend to anyone.�,5
277,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I was first introduced to the group at SCOI in 2006| in need of an elbow operation. Being a former professional athlete| I had many injuries during the course of my career and many fixes that needed to be done upon retirement. I had been a patient of another orthopedic group| but felt that my needs could be met elsewhere. Upon researching SCOI| my choice was made. It was local to me| the doctor's were astounding| and it was as state of the art as my former surgeons| maybe even more. After successful left elbow surgery| I returned for right elbow surgery. Both of these procedures and their following rehabilitation could not have ended any better. My big scare came this year when I found I needed right shoulder reconstruction| two tears in the rotator cuff| three labral tears| biceps tendon tear| bone chips| and bone spur. I knew full well that this was a complicated and serious procedure. I never once considered returning to my previous surgical team. Dr. Burns was always my first choice for this harrowing operation. I am eleven weeks out of surgery on the road to recovery. In fact| I�m typing with my right arm in this email. My standing pain is gone. My physical therapy is on track| even knowing that there is a full eight to twelve month recovery. I could be in no better hands than the doctors and staff at SCOI. My 20-year-old son| a college pitcher| is also a proud patient of SCOI. He sees Dr. Burns and Dr. Barcohana. While never needing surgery| their treatment of his right elbow issues has led to his first pain free throwing season. Thanks to all of you at SCOI!�,5
278,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�Dr. Karzel and his assisting physician did extensive reconstruction of my right shoulder rotator cuff. My recovery| elimination of discomfort| and returned mobility has been outstanding. My heart felt thank yous to Dr. Karzel and all of his staff.�,5
279,Andrew M. Blecher| MD,�I received immediate relief from pain and then a clear path to treat the main cause of my hip injury| not just the symptom.�,5
280,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I suffered a severe rotator cuff injury in September 2010. I had been through two surgeries on my shoulder and one on my wrist [injuries from the same accident]. On March 1| 2012| Dr. Guanche performed a reverse total shoulder replacement. I was only in the hospital overnight| began physical therapy 21 days later| and have never regretted the surgery. Dr. Guanche is a quality professional| and informed me of what to expect from the surgery. When I began physical therapy| my physical therapist was amazed at my range of motion and I had virtually NO PAIN. My range of motion was better on my first visit after this surgery| than it was after nearly eight months of physical therapy following the previous surgery. It has been a year since the surgery| and I am still experiencing no pain| range of motion is good| but has limitations as explained before the surgery. This surgery| and the care SCOI employees have given me are remarkable. I don't regret it for one second.�,5
281,Paul M. Simic| MD,�On December 16| 2012| I was involved in a motorcycle accident| caused by a reckless automobile driver| who left the scene| with me unconscious on the freeway.

I must say this is a great facility| staffed by great professional in the field. I was fortunate to have highly skilled surgeon in| Dr. Paul Simic| who was very personable in attending to my needs. I am most grateful to the great skills and knowledge he has acquired in his field. Thanks to him and the great staff| I am now on the road of recovery from a torn rotator cuff| a torn bicep muscle| and another torn shoulder ligament.�,1
282,A. Elizabeth Bloz�| MD,�She has been the first doctor in over 10 years who could figure out why I have been experiencing so much pain in my lower back and hip. Thank you!�,5
283,A. Elizabeth Bloz�| MD,�I had a knee injury that Dr. Bloze looked into by doing X-Rays and a MRI. Once she determined the injury she quickly referred me to Dr. Friedman. SCOI is clearly a one stop medical facility. I love that the doctors can easily communicate and share information via the computer medical records route. This makes it so very easy in getting quick and complete treatment with several doctors sharing their opinions. It is very comforting.�,5
284,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�Treated very kindly| made to feel comfortable since I was very nervous. I didn�t have to sit in waiting room very long| or in preoperative very long. I was very comfortable and pain free. The anesthesiologist was amazing. I hope if any future medical problems of this nature| I will prefer to go to Southern California Orthopedic Institute.�,5
285,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�Left shoulder - Torn rotator cuff and small tear in my bicep. Third day after surgery all is good. I have had two other surgeries with SCOI. Both times my experience with SCOI has been outstanding.�,5
286,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�When I first saw Dr. Hernandez I was in severe pain. Dr Hernandez said I was a great candidate for a total hip replacement. To say Dr. Hernandez was outstanding would be an understatement. The next morning after surgery I was up and walking. There was pain but not as severe as prior to surgery. Two days after surgery I was up and walking around by myself with only the aid of a walker. A week after being home I was walking around the block with the walker and having very little pain. On the second week I was using only a cane and had slight soreness at the incision. After five weeks I was back at work pain free and wondering how did I ever put up with so much pain. Thank you Dr. Hernandez for and outstanding job!�,5
287,Kamil Erfanian| MD,�First of all what a wonderful experience. Everyone in the front office (up stairs) has always been polite and very professional. As for the surgical area (downstairs) what a delight! Seriously| I go into surgeries nervous as I'm sure most people do. They made me feel very comfortable. They honestly got me right in and right out. What an AMAZING place. Thank you SCOI!�,5
288,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�Both of my daughters have been treated by SCOI| and their experiences from diagnosis to surgery and then rehabilitation have been excellent; so when I started to play tennis regularly and a knee situation came up| of course my first thought was to come and see Dr. Karzel and his staff at SCOI. Their experience| knowledge| and welcoming attitude is the best. I recommend SCOI to anyone who asks about a reference to an orthopedist!�,5
289,Robert Gazmarian| MD,�I had arthritis in my right knee. I couldn't play tennis or golf. Under Dr. Gazmarian�s care| I received synvisc shots. Over several weeks| my knee started to feel better and I was able to get to tennis and golf. I am getting shots in both knees now and am able to do the things I love.�,5
290,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I had rotator cuff surgery and was treated on both knees for pain. I believe I received the best care ever by the complete staff. Stacey| Elizabeth Brown| and every one involved were so professional and made me feel comfortable during all procedures. Couldn't ask for more. I would only go there and highly recommend SCOI to anyone who has orthopedic problems.�,5
291,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I ruptured my Achilles tendon on December 22| 2012. I saw Dr. Bahk and he recommended surgery. The surgery was scheduled on January 10 and everything went smoothly. I followed doctors orders and went through physical therapy. Feeling great!�,5
292,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�I never thought I would have to have shoulder surgery| but I did. Then| I thought it would take a long time recovering after surgery. It didn't. I was amazed how well I felt after two weeks| and I was able to return to work. It has been seven-and-a-half months since I had surgery| and I am doing workouts with weights and bands to strengthen my muscles along with other cardio workouts. I am forever grateful for the expertise and caring practices of Dr. Karzel for fixing not only my shoulder but also my frayed biceps. My son also had knee surgery performed by Dr. Karzel| and we were both impressed by how well he took the time to explain exactly what happened and how he was going to fix the problem. Surgery is not so scary after all.�,5
293,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�From the top down| the care that I received at SCOI was amazing. Their doctors| all subspecialty trained| are top notch. One just look at their collective experience| education| and reputation and it's crystal clear. Further| the entire staff is very professional and thorough. From my first visit with Dr. Molnar for diagnosis| to my surgical experience with Dr. Getelman| I was treated with the highest level of professional care that I could ask for. I am thankful to the entire staff for that professionalism and attention to detail that every patient needs.�,5
294,Andrew M. Blecher| MD,�I have a bum right knee. Both doctors did a great job and I'm know going for physical therapy at SCOI with Brian the therapist. He's really good. Keep up the good work!!!�,5
295,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I had surgery on my hip. Prior to the procedure I was in continuous pain. I was at the point where it was unbearable. My pain reduction was almost immediate. This surgery has improved my life drastically!�,5
296,Deborah A. Casta�eda| MD,�The SCOI staff has been very accommodating and Dr. Castaneda is wonderful. Steve Markman is a true professional| with a heart.�,5
297,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�I'm sure I have the best doctor. Having any surgery is always difficult| but Dr. Jaivin is always so wonderful. He always takes his time with you. My surgery was smooth and my recovery was easy. My bunion was taken care of and my recovery was quick. All of the office and surgery staff are great people. Yojana Mauricio is always so helpful and friendly. I was never apprehensive going in for appointments.�,5
298,Gregory J. Hanker| MD,�While rollerblading| I fell and broke my wrist. It was the most horrible experience ever| but I could say that Dr. Hanker was amazing as well as the staff! Dr. Hanker was very friendly and nice in making sure I understood how everything was going to go. He went step by step because I have never had a broken bone or had to go to the doctor for an emergency situation like this. Thank you to the SCOI staff| who helped me with my therapy sessions and being able to move my hand again back to normal. I would totally recommend him and the SCOI staff to everyone!!�,5
299,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I had a series of five shots for knee arthritis and am awaiting final results. I have an appointment with Dr. Getelman in July to evaluate. I am impressed with the general handling of appointments and prompt service. This is my first time with SCOI. I chose it because of my daughter's experience there.�,5
300,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I had a left shoulder reversal| ugh. It really went very well. The pain was rough for a couple of weeks. I am now six months out| feeling great with NO pain. I have some limitations and I can certainly live with them. Everyone at Southern California Orthopedic Institute was great. I have to have the right shoulder done in the future and definitely will use SCOI again. By the way| I live in Colorado and felt Dr. Guanche was the best. I was right.�,5
301,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�Dr. Snyder is a wonderful doctor. He cares about the person| the effect that the ailment has on your life| and takes time to talk| listen| and probe. I saw him previously| ten years ago as well as recently. He has exceeded my expectations. What is most interesting is that he is never in a rush to move ahead with surgery until it is certain that surgery is what is needed. I also was on board with the decision. Unfortunately| this last visit is for a problem that cannot currently be cured by surgery. Dr. Snyder was very thorough in his examination and review of the tests that were run. He discussed the condition completely and let me know what the future course of my condition would be and how best to deal with this over time. I have the highest regard for Dr. Snyder and look forward to seeing him again for follow-ups.�,5
302,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�I am recovering very well from the hammer toe(s) correction. Dr. Jaivin is the best! And has a great staff too! Thanks!�,5
303,Todd D. Moldawer| MD,�I came to see the doctor as a result of severe lower back pain| which radiated to my legs as well. Although less invasive treatments were attempted eventually I needed a laminectomy. It is now just past one year of my surgery and I am essentially pain free. I am back to the gym working out| my posture has improved immensely| and I am now able to walk long distances without pain as well! My complete respect for Dr. Moldawer and Dealie Park his assistant with the awesome results I attained after surgery.�,5
304,Gregory J. Hanker| MD,�While rollerblading| I fell and broke my wrist. It was the most horrible experience ever| but I could say that Dr. Hanker was amazing as well as the staff!

310,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�Dr. Snyder is a wonderful doctor. He cares about the person| the effect that the ailment has on your life| and takes time to talk| listen| and probe.

I have the highest regard for Dr. Snyder and look forward to seeing him again for follow-ups.�,5
311,Todd J. Molnar| MD,�I went to Dr. Molnar after seeing other doctors about my sciatic nerve pain. While I was given epidurals in the past| I saw that Dr. Molnar was more thorough in his examination| like giving me a nerve test to make sure the nerves were not damaged. No one thought to do that in the past. I found him to be very patient. He listened to my story and then he made a plan for me| which included an epidural in a more formal setting. He asked me to follow up after a week and suggested I continue with therapy. I have the utmost confidence in Dr. Molnar.�,5
312,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I had a series of five shots for knee arthritis and am awaiting final results. I have an appointment with Dr. Getelman in July to evaluate.

314,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�A friend referred me to SCOI and to Dr. Getelman. He did major repair work on my shoulder. We were impressed by his knowledge and skill. His assistant| Stacey| was also great. She knew her business and was always cheerful and sunny. I am still under Dr. Getelman's care and he's taking very good care of me! I've enjoyed being his patient and my shoulder is getting stronger everyday.�,5
315,William H. Mouradian| MD,�I was hurt on the job. After being run around for over a year| I was referred to Dr. Mouradian. I was very frustrated by this point| but he took the time to listen and work with me. Four weeks ago| I had back surgery| and I already have great improvement. I can stand a little straighter. I only wish it had not taken nearly 4 years to get some results| not the fault of Dr. Mouradian. If only I had gone to him first. Jennet his receptionist/nurse was so much help as well as all the staff. They were always very professional and took good care of me| even when I was not having such a good day. Thanks to all of them| I am on the road to putting my life back in order. Thank you all very much.�,5
316,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I would HIGHLY recommend Dr. Guanche! I went in with shoulder pain from tennis| and was quickly diagnosed with bone spurs on my rotator cuff as well as some tears. Professional and amazing staff! From day one| I was treated with care and experience. Appointments were on time and my healing was quick. In fact| my physical therapist said that I must have had a great doctor| since I had very little bruising! It has now been 7 months| and I am back to playing tennis! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!�,5
317,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�Southern California Orthopedic Institute is impressive from the moment I made my consultation appointment| paying attention to details! Dr. Stephen Snyder made me feel like I was his friend with his most genuine friendliness| kindness| warmth| and caring mannerisms. So without hesitation| this was my very first major surgery| I knew that Dr. Snyder would do my right shoulder surgery and then my left shoulder 6 months later! Maria is efficient! She surely helped to make me feel at ease with all the appointments I needed. The staff in each department was very efficient! Personable! Helpful! I will continue to refer anyone to SCOI. Three of my friends have also had their shoulder surgeries by Dr. Snyder in the last year. Oh| yes| my shoulders are terrifically healed!!!! Thank you so much| Dr. Snyder!�,5
318,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I tore my meniscus 2 years ago and was in terrible pain and could not walk. I saw Dr. Bahk and he suggested I have surgery to correct the problem. The surgery went perfectly. At a follow up with the doctor a month later| he instructed me to start walking a little every day. I began walking small distances every day. Since then| I have been walking 5 miles a day for two years| have walked almost 1|500 miles| and worn out 3 pair of walking shoes. My knee has been pain free and it's as if I have a brand new knee. On a cruise I took last year| I walked around the island of Bora Bora in French Polynesia| a dream I've had for 20 years. Dr. Bahk saved my knee as well as my future. By the way| I'm 70 years young! Thank you| SCOI and especially| Dr. Bahk.�,5
319,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I had lower back pain and the surgery went well. I had the surgery on Monday and was on my way home by Thursday.The nurses at the Valley Presbyterian Hospital were all great.�,4
320,Deborah A. Casta�eda| MD,�Dr. Castaneda was exceptional in her thorough examination| follow up| and prescription for my ankle injury. I felt that she only suggested what was truly in my best interest| and never pushed for unnecessary tests or exams| x-rays etc. She never rushed through our visits| made sure I knew what was coming next| and what to expect. She took a conservative approach. I healed very well and fast| considering the extent of the damage to my ankle and surrounding muscle and tissue. Her assistant| Steve was a huge help| well informed| knowledgeable| and always in a good mood| even if they were busy. He stayed in touch with me during the 3-month healing process| and was always easy to reach if I had questions. He would get back to me quickly if my question needed to be answered by Dr. Castaneda. Overall| I hope I never have to go back| but if by chance I do| I would return with complete confidence that I will be well taken care of.�,5
321,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�I have been waiting for my knee surgery for years. I was in a very bad car accident 8 years ago| at the young age of 21. It almost left me without my legs all together. I was referred to Southern California Orthopedic Institute and they informed me that my leg has healed enough for the hardware| which has been causing me so much pain| can finally come out. I was so thrilled! I'm scheduled for my surgery August 13th. The staff and doctor have been very kind and informative in prepping me mentally and physically for the surgery. I thank the doctor and the staff for their kindness and understanding.�,5
322,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Just over a year ago| I was trying to get on my roof when the extension ladder I was climbing slipped under me and dropped me on my driveway. Thanks to a friend's recommendation| I got a visit with Dr. Hernandez. I knew my hip was hurt| but he quickly noticed my wrist and brought his college Dr. Simic to investigate. The two of them worked all afternoon on the wrist to avoid emergency surgery| but after few hours| they realized I needed surgery quickly before the nerve died. Just after 10 pm that Friday night| Dr. Simic performed the first of the 4 surgeries I would receive from these two amazing men. After going through the first hip rehab| with my wrist in a cast| and then the wrist rehab| I have a new appreciation for the therapists of the world| and especially| the ones at SCOI. Every day they meet people who are hurt physically and mentally| and just when they get them fixed up| they have to say goodbye and hopefully for a long time. To say the least| I'm back in the shape I was in before the accident| running| biking| swimming| and working out just as hard as I did previously| but now with additional knowledge of how to stretch when I'm sore. As a thank you| I included all of them on my Christmas card list| and plan to continue| as I want them to know how I'm doing| thanks to their help.�,5
323,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�When I needed an orthopedic specialist for my knees| my daughter (PA-C) researched the best for the western US and advised me that Dr. Christopher Hamilton was her choice. I could not be happier with the way I have been treated as a patient and the treatment. I have had one knee replacement by Dr. Hamilton and people cannot tell that I have had the surgery by the way I walk or stand. His entire staff| especially Bob Brennan (PA-C) and Jamie| has been excellent since my very first visit to SCOI. I have referred everyone that has talked to me about my experience| and recommended that they should arrange their physical therapy at SCOI as well. I am currently being treated by this great team at SCOI for my other knee and will have Dr. Hamilton do that surgery as well. There is no better choice anywhere.�,5
324,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�This was my second surgery by Dr. Hamilton. The first surgery was for my right shoulder post rotator cuff injury| and now the left shoulder. With the right shoulder| I found him to be extremely competent and thorough. My recovery progressed normally| and by the end of a year 1| was pain free| with full mobility of my shoulder. This time around the surgery was elective for bone spur removal. During surgery| Dr. Hamilton discovered that my rotator cuff was significantly torn and affected the repairs as needed. Although he had asked for clearance to make repairs| if he discovered anything else| it wasn't expected. Because of my job| I find myself lifting heavy loads and he remembered that. Making the unexpected repairs now will likely prevent me from coming in for more surgery in a year or two. His concern for my long-term welfare is appreciated. My post-op follow-up with Dr. Hamilton and Robert Brennan| his physician assistant| has been what was expected. Neither Dr. Hamilton nor Mr. Brennan has ever failed to answer my questions adequately. I appreciate that they are extremely honest with me and give me correct information| even when I may not have wanted to hear it. I have and will continue to recommend Dr. Hamilton and his office to my friends.�,5
325,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�Dr. Jaivin is a wonderful doctor. He has performed fascia release surgery on both of my feet. Now I don't have any foot pain caused by plantar fasciitis! I appreciate his expertise and professionalism. His medical assistant| Johanna| is very organized and great with Dr. Jaivin's patients. She returns calls quickly and is very knowledgeable. I highly recommend Dr. Jaivin to anyone who is suffering from foot pain.�,5
326,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�This is our third experience with SCOI. Dr. Karzel operated on my son twice| and me once. All have been very good experiences. We have recovered and are doing well. Dr. Karzel explained everything well to us| and the follow-up went well too. I appreciated the care I received and the success of the surgery.�,5
327,Trevor P. Lynch| MD| FACS,�This is the 2nd time I relied on Dr. Lynch's expertise. The first was for trigger finger| where pulley surgery corrected my hand. The second was for helping with tennis elbow| where I had inflammation brought on by a dangerously infamous drug. I received the best of treatment from Dr. Lynch and the SCOI staff and therapists. Thee best!�,5
328,Robert Gazmarian| MD,�Dr. Gazmarian has been treating me for several years for different orthopedic problems. Towards the end of March| I visited Dr. Gazmarian with a complaint of severe left knee pain| which the cause was unknown. After an MRI in early April| a diagnosis of a meniscal tear was made. I had an injection of cortisone into my left knee| which did not relieve the pain. At that point| I was advised that I had two choices| the first was surgery to repair the tear or the second was a course of physical therapy. I chose the latter| although it was a long and tedious process. I had reservations about surgery at my age of 92. Physical therapy lasted until the end of May. By that time my severe knee pain had diminished to just occasional moderate pain. I am grateful to Dr. Gazmarian for his patient| concerned attitude towards me at all my visits and also to the dedication and patience of the physical therapy staff.�,5
329,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�My experience with Dr. Snyder and everyone at SCOI has been great. From the initial consultation to the post-op follow ups| Dr. Snyder has been very thorough in explaining all aspects of the surgery. I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone who requires his services.�,5
330,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�On Thanksgiving break of 2012| Dr. Karzel performed ACL replacement surgery on my then 15 year old son as a result of a football injury. In February of 2013| just three months after surgery| Roger's physical therapist said there was nothing more he could do for him. Under the physical therapist's supoervision| Roger was doing everything on his knee with no ill effects from the injury or the surgery. When I asked the physical therapist why he was doing so well after such a catastrophic injury in such a short time| he said Roger was 15 years old and had a good surgeon. In May of 2013| Dr. Karzel cleared Roger to play his first love| lacrosse| again. In the summer and fall of 2013| Roger competed in many lacrosse tournaments and caught the eye of many a collegiate coach that are looking at Roger for collegiate level lacrosse. I would like to thank Dr. Karzel and all the folks at SCOI for such a wonderful outcome to a catastrophic injury.�,1
331,Robert Gazmarian| MD,�As you can tell by my check list of Doctors| I have spent more than a little time at SCOI. As a former Motocross Racer| I sustained injuries that ranged from broken ankles| to a tibial plateau fracture| to hand fractures and finally bulging discs in my back. Every experience at SCOI has been absoultely fantastic. The doctors are all caring| patient and really know their specialty. I rode bikes with a group of about 10 guys and every one of them has| at one time| visited SCOI and received the same superior care. I still come in every once in a while with back flare ups| or other small issues. Dr. Gazmarian is the doctor I see first and there are no words to express the respect and appreciation I have for him. No matter how long it is between visists| he ALWAYS remembers me and is as friendly| kind and encouraging as any doctor I've ever visited. You really get the feeling that he makes it his personal mission to see that you leave there feeling better| or at least with a plan to help you feel better in the future. I have referred many folks to Dr G.| including my wife| who is terrified of doctors| but is comfortable and stress free when she sees him. To me| SCOI is the only place I would ever think of going in regards to my orthopedic health. Thank you for all you have done for me over the years.�,5
332,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�I had a large full thickness tear in my rotator cuff. Dr Snyder repaired it using a skin graft. I am very thankful for this procedure and am doing Physical Therapy at the present time.�,5
333,Paul M. Simic| MD,�I love all the doctors at SCOI as they has help my husband with several issue in his back. However| Dr. Simic is an awesome doctor for helping me with my hands. I am a guitar player and work on the computer and have had several issues with my fingers and hands. Dr. Simic is extremely kind| professional and has the skills of a top notch doctor| which is the only kind of doctor you want! Any orthopedic problems I have| it's a phone call to SCOI!�,5
334,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�During recovery from a rotator cuff repair| not performed by SCOI| I began experiencing significant pain and loss of muscle strength. The doctor who had performed the surgery was not receptive to my concerns that I was regressing rather than progressing during recovery. My family doctor and I concluded that a second opinion would be worthwhile| and I decided to seek two different opinions. The first doctor I saw suggested that my original surgery didn't work and needed to be redone. My daughter who is a physical therapist| had a patient who had a shoulder surgery done by Dr. Snyder at SCOI| and she recommended that I talk with him. I met with Dr. Snyder| and after reviewing my records| examining| and talking with me| identified what he thought the problem was. He clearly laid out the options that were available| thoroughly explaining each one| and then very clearly left the option selection entirely up to me. I elected to have a second surgery on my shoulder| this time reattaching a bicep tendon. Dr. Snyder performed the surgery after telling me that he would go in| look at the previous surgery and my shoulder in its entirety| and if there was not a torn bicep tendon| or other significant problem| that he would close me up and send me on my way| not performing any unnecessary surgery. Following the surgery| Dr. Snyder presented me with a CD that contained the video and his narrative of the surgery. The problem was as he suspected as the previous surgery had healed properly| and with the repair Dr. Snyder performed| my shoulder has been doing very well. I have been able to return to all of my normal activities. The care I received was great! -- Bob H.�,5
335,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I have had the best treatment experience at SCOI| regarding my left knee treatment. The staff took the time to explain everything regarding my operation to the final release after treatment. One individual from Dr. Getelmen�s staff| Stacey was the most wonderful person to treat me and to get results from the insurance company| who rejected treatments. She went above and beyond to make sure I got all the treatments that I needed.�,5
336,Kamil Erfanian| MD,�From the first appointment onward| I found the doctors and staff at Southern California Orthopedic Institute in Bakersfield to be extremely professional and helpful. I suffered a tear in the cartilage| stretched some tendons in my left hand| and had surgery by Dr. Erfanian. I felt at ease and comfortable throughout the entire pre-op and post-op experience and received excellent care from all of my nurses| techs| and doctors. Their experience and care were instrumental in my healing. At 13 weeks post-op| I have regained full range of motion in my hand| with only minimal pain during some movements. I would highly recommend both Dr. Erfanian and SCOI to anyone looking for the best in orthopedic care. Thank you SCOI!�,1
337,Kamil Erfanian| MD,�I had carpel tunnel| trigger finger| and numbness in my hand. The surgery went very well| and I have no problems using my hand. The nurses were very pleasant| and checked on me often to make sure I was doing okay. I would recommend Dr. Erfanian to anyone needing hand surgery.�,5
338,John L. Etcheverry| DPM,�I had blunt force trauma to my left ankle from a skim boarding accident. I was unable to perform physical activity without swelling or numbness. My ankle never healed| and after 8 months| I decided to go to SCOI. After my surgery and physical therapy| I'm now able to do the things I love like swimming and kickboxing. Thanks guys!�,5
339,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I walked around for nine months| being misdiagnosed| from one Doctor to another| until I went to Dr. Hernandez. He showed me my X-ray which showed that my hip was bone on bone. I scheduled surgery to have hip replacement| in November. It was a total success. I now walk limp free| no pain or discomfort of any type. The procedure he used was called anterior which was much quicker to recover. I am so grateful to Dr. Hernandez and his PA Mr. Montoya| plus the whole team. All were very professional and caring. I feel like I got my life back and can do all the things I used to do. - Dawn P.�,5
340,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�Since it was my first major injury at age 20| my experience was life changing. I'm a soccer player from Texas| which was recruited to Taft College to play on the soccer team. Unfortunately| I suffered a knee injury that caused me to undergo ACL reconstruction surgery| which caused me to be off the field for six months. Sadly| I went back to the doctor with the news that I tore the ACL allograph. The new procedure was a patella tendon graph for my second ACL reconstruction surgery. Right now| I'm currently training with the Taft soccer team. I want to thanks Dr. Christopher Hamilton and all of the staff from Southern California Orthopedic Institute for the tremendous capacity and professionalism with orthopedics. Thank you for making it possible for me to go back and enjoy the beautiful game of soccer.�,5
341,Todd Shapiro| MD,�Tripped and fell| again! Broke my shoulder and required a full shoulder replacement. Did I mention I'm 65? SCOI in Bakersfield handled everything. All I had to do was show up. Since this was a workers� comp situation| their expertise and attention to detail certainly put my mind at ease.�,5
342,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Dr. Hernandez is amazing! I had a total hip replacement on my right side. He was very thorough when I met with him for the pre-op appointment to ensure that the correct size stem was used based on the size of my bones. He had encouraging words about what I'd be able to do after my surgery. In fact| his words repeated in my mind with any activity I engaged in after surgery. My surgery was performed at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. I received clear instructions on preparing for the day of surgery. After surgery| the hospital staff was fabulous as I was in recovery. I recommend Dr. Hernandez to anyone who needs a hip replacement.�,5
343,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�It is a year since my shoulder surgery and I want to thank Dr. Snyder for his expertise as a surgeon and his exceptionally warm and caring manner. From my first appointment with him through the surgery and the post surgical appointments he has been kind| compassionate| and everything I could wish for in a doctor! I am pleased to tell him hat the surgery was a great success and I have been able to realize my goal of returning to swimming with the crawl stroke| something that I was unable to do for years before the operation. I first met him when in I was visiting Los Angeles from Montreal| Canada. I had got to know physiotherapist| Vince N.| when he was treating a member of my family and when I told him about my shoulder pain he recommended that I make an appointment to see Dr. Snyder. I am grateful to Vince for his advice| and also for the therapy that I subsequently had with him. I had returned to Montreal where I had physical therapy both in local private and public systems| but I felt that I had plateaued and was feeling discouraged when I returned to LA for a month during the summer. Vince worked with me doing therapy in the pool| and I made great progress. His technique is remarkable and I attribute the final stages of my recovery to his expert care. Finally| I want to thank Dr. Snyder's nurse Maria for always being helpful and patient when I called with questions and concerns. I cannot overemphasize what a special experience it was to have my surgery under Dr. Snyder's care. His professionalism| kindness| and patience inspire confidence| and make a difficult experience as easy as possible. At every step of the process he were reassuring and I never felt hurried or intimidated in his presence. Thank you Dr. Snyder. You are truly an excellent doctor and a very special person.�,1
344,John L. Etcheverry| DPM,�I had blunt force trauma to my left ankle from a skim boarding accident. I was unable to perform physical activity without swelling or numbness.

349,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�From the very start| my experience with your staff - pre-op and post-op has been a very pleasant and professional relationship. I was fearful of additional pain to my shoulder| but my fears were quickly diminished by open communication with all that were involved in my corrective/repair surgery. My surgeon was open with me and his staff followed my progress after to assure that I was pain free and that my rehabilitation was scheduled properly and appropriately. I've had both shoulders done almost twenty years ago and was expecting the same painful treatment I recieved then| to my surprise this experience was totally different. This surgery center will always be recommended to my close friends and family members.�,5
350,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I had a great experience at SCOI| Dr Getelman is very good & thorough| also loved Stacey Gerbrandt.

I would definitely recommend SCOI to my family & friends.�,5
351,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I am so excited that I might still be able to go fishing once again. At the age of 61 I had my first of 4 surgery's and special injections to repair my right shoulder| and nothing has worked. I am scheduled for right shoulder reverse surgery on February 12| 2015. Since 2010| I have not been able to lift my right shoulder without pain| and my range of motion has been very restricted. This surgery is my last hope to go back to what I love the most| fishing in the Pacific Ocean for BIG fish.�,5
352,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�I received a bunionectomy| or so I thought| from another Doctor at a different Medical Group. After 9 months of my foot not being right| not being able to wear closed shoes without pain| and| one excuse after another from my prior Doctor| I made an appointment with Dr. Jaivin. BEST thing I could have done for myself. Dr. Jaivin performed a bunionectomy and my entire post healing process was completely different than the first time| I HEALED this time. I was back to walking in closed shoes within 8 weeks of surgery and the incision is perfect with no bumps or knots| it is totally FLAT and free of pain. I recommend Dr. Jaivin to anyone who is looking to feel better and get back to doing what they enjoy - living life!�,5
353,Todd J. Molnar| MD,�Dr. Molnar is a fantastic doctor. I had a long and protracted problem with my neck and upper back and he was extremely thorough in diagnosing the problem and getting me on the right path to healing. As a result| I am feeling very good and I have gained insight and knowledge around the problem I have been experiencing. I highly recommend him!!�,5

357,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I went to see Dr. Bahk with extreme knee pain. I had previously had miniscus surgery with another surgeon one year before. I never felt that my first surgery was successful as I was in constant pain. Dr. Bahk is an amazing Orthopedic Surgeon! I can not thank him enough for giving me full use of my knee again! While Dr. Bahk did my surgery he video taped it and talked to me like I was awake and explained everything he was doing. He continued to say my name during the entire procedure. When I got home and was able to watch the procedure| it felt like Dr. Bahk was in the room with me| explaining everything! Dr. Bahk made me feel so comfortable before| during and after my surgery! Thank you Dr. Bahk for your personal touch!!�,5
358,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�So I am a cement/concrete finisher and use my hands| arms| and knees on a daily basis. I have been suffering from shoulder pain for months. I have trouble doing my job and living a normal life pain free. So I was referred to SCOI and ended up choosing Dr. Karzel and my experience from day one with him and SCOI's staff have been excellent. I just had my surgery 3 days ago and even though I'm in pain recovering as I type this message| it is well worth it to me. I strongly recommend him and everyone I have came across through physical therapy to Dr. Appt's have spoken highly of him. I know and am sure I will recover and be back to normal soon. Staff in the Van Nuys office were outstanding| from the anesthesiologist to the Dr. doing the nerve block procedure made me feel really comfortable and not worried at all. The nurse Jennifer H. and OR nurse Kindra were really nice and professional. Thank you all. - Jimmy M.�,1
359,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�I can't tell you enough how wonderful everyone is. I was treated kindly and carefully. Because my husband and I had boys that played football in the Santa Clarita Valley| Dr. Karzel was the go to ortho guy. We have known him for years. He did shoulder surgery on my husband in 1993. It was very hard for him because he got full surgery. I just had the orthoscopic surgery. My husband is very jealous because after 3 weeks| I can pull up my pants on my own (anyone who has had this surgery knows what an accomplishment that is). I absolutely love Healthloop. I hope the person that did that program gets lots and lots of money. It's really nice to get answers to questions almost immediately. I don't think| given the choice| that I would go to any other ortho place. I am constantly telling people to go to SCOI.�,5
360,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Extremely pleased with Dr Hernandez in all phases of care. Provided detailed information and answered all questions prior to surgery. Surgery went as planned and as I was prepared for. Post op has been exactly as I was told it would be and I am very happy with the outcome. � Rich M. �,5
361,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�After researching SCOI| I found them to be on the cutting edge for this type of surgery. I also chose Jaime Hernandez| M.D. for the method he uses to line up the knee replacement with his computerized system to get the replacement in the perfect spot. I have had my other knee replaced 14 years ago & had it done by Dr. Khrazzi at Kerlon Jobe & the knee has been great| but this doctor no longer does knee replacements. I was also referred to SCOI by my nurse practioner| Stephanie Wade. I know the importance of getting the knee replacement done correctly or you can have no success. I have seen so many people with botched knee replacements. I was amazed at 71 years old how fast I progressed with my recovery. My P.T. therapy instructor said I should be the poster child for SCOI & Dr. Hernandez| as he had never seen anyone recover so fast with such success. Dr. Hernandez even told me his other patients that were in same time frame as me were all complaining of not being able to sleep| in pain etc. I went off pain meds after the 2nd week of surgery. I attribute my success to Dr. Hernandez' technique with the computerized system in lining up the knee to my success. I am very grateful I found SCOI. - Shirley D.�,5
362,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I broke the neck of my femur. Dr. Hernandez saw me right before the operation and was very calming and encouraging. He explained exactly what he was going to do and what I could expect. He told me I had the best break possible and could expect a rapid recovery. I felt reassured and positive. I have a small scar and my recovery has gone very well. Dr. Hernandez is a great surgeon!�,5
363,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�First| I had a partially torn rotator cuff a couple years back| and Dr. Getelman prescribed exercises and injections that got me back to playing tennis in good time without any surgery. This time| I blew out my knee from overuse and kneeling too much. No tears fortunately. Mostly arthritis. Stacey drained it and Dr. Getelman prescribed 4 weeks of PT and 4 hyaluronic acid injections. Jessica in PT was great. By the end| I was about 95% back to normal. The injections helped and I'm back to playing tennis; although| I can't sprint like I used to. Hopefully| this will get better in time. Dr. Jaivin saw me for a bulge in my foot| but MRI's didn't show anything untoward. After applying the Rx ointment| the swelling has pretty much died down. Great facility. Great staff.�,5
364,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�Great doctor. Took time to walk through everything. Would see him again if needed.�,5
365,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I have had shoulder pain for the past 2-1/2 years. I degraded my shoulder through 30 to 40 years of heavy weightlifting| and was finally able to really hurt myself to the point where I could not do upper body weight training any longer. And soon after| I suffered a couple of bad mountain bike crashes that did further damage to the same shoulder. After a couple of MRI's and two meetings with a local surgeon in San Luis Obispo| I became quite frustrated because he would only subscribe PT for a problem that I was certain would not go away through PT. During my second visit to see my local surgeon| he didn't even look at the second MRI| which was very disconcerting. And our meeting lasted only about 10 minutes. Following my second doctors appointment| SCOI was recommended to me by a close friend who had corrective surgery done by one of your staff doctors. After contacting SCOI and setting up an appointment to see Dr. Getelman| I was immediately struck by how professional he and his staff were| and how closely they looked into my shoulder MRI and he ordered an additional battery of x-rays that took 2 or 3 additional views of the effected shoulder. Dr. Getelman spent quite a bit of time with me to explain in more detail what was going on with my shoulder and gave me the options that were available to me. I elected to go through arthroscopic surgery. And although it has only been about 4 weeks since surgery| I could not be happier with the surgery experience (which is my first surgery) and the post-op attention I am receiving from Dr. Getelman and his staff. I just received the go ahead from Dr. Getelman to begin physical therapy and I only wish I could receive that treatment from SCOI! In addition to wonderful care| I received an in-depth DVD of the actual surgery| which is incredible to watch. I had no idea it required such talent and experience to fix a bum shoulder! Even though it is about a 185 mile drive from my home to the SCOI clinic| it is a drive that is well worth the time and effort| every time that I make it.�,5
366,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I have to express my satisfaction with Dr. Guanche. He is a very personable doctor and extremely knowledgeable in his field. I saw Dr. Guanche for my second hip surgery| I had a tear in the ligaments in my right hip. I have a very physically demanding job that requires a lot of lifting and walking. I have not walked pain-free for at least 5 years| I had my surgery June 2015 and since then I feel like a million dollars! The rehab department was excellent and definitely helped me get back to 100%. I just wanted to thank Dr. Guanche| and the entire SCOI staff for getting me put back together. This is my second time having a surgery with SCOI and both times the results have exceeded my expectations! Thank you again for all your help! � Jose T. �,5
367,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�Back to Dr. Jaivin's today for a check-up on Matthew's foot and cast. The good news| the cast is off and the bad news... well| there is none! Dr. Jaivin said Matthew is doing great. He's excited to play basketball again (starting Monday) and get back to his work at the Oak Creek Corral. Now a word about Dr. Jaivin| an orthopedic foot and ankle specialist at Southern California Orthopedic Institute. This physician is wonderful! Not only is he skilled with regard to his profession| but I really loved the way he interacted with my son. He spoke TO Matthew| showed interest in him| and sought answers to questions from him. He addressed me (mom) only to clarify or obtain information Matthew was not able to give. At the beginning of Matthew's treatment I expressed concern that Matt gets sidelined due to his developmental disabilities and I wanted him (Dr. Jaivin) to know that even though he's not a bazillion dollar money maker in the sports industry| it was important to Matthew and his quality of life to be able to walk and play sports. Dr. Jaivin immediately responded that all of his patients were important and her certainly has proved that to be true. Dr. Jaivin| we really appreciate your kind| attentive| and knowledgeable care! Thank you!�,5
368,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�It is hard to believe| but I have never had a better experience before and after surgery. My doctor was right on time. Him and his staff made me feel I was in good hands.�,5
369,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�Dr. Jaivin - and the entire staff at Southern California Orthopedic Institute - has been an amazing help while I have been recovering from a foot fracture. From day one until today - 9 weeks later - I have felt like I am in extremely loving and capable hands. Everyone at SCOI has been very friendly and helpful| and instead of pushing sales of their own equipment| they are realistic in the need for patients to save money. I absolutely adore that they replace the casts every two weeks| allowing for the patients to remain a LOT more comfortable than wearing the same cast for 6-8 weeks straight. I have been through a fractured foot before| during which time I was under the care of a different orthopedist| and the recovery was a lot more torturous than this time around. I truly believe that going to SCOI has made a horrible situation much more manageable. - Lynsey S.�,1
370,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�Dr. Guanche and his staff are top notch. I have had 3 surgeries with his team (2 proximal hamstring repairs and 1 hip impingement/labral repair). Each experience with Dr. Guanche| his office| and his surgical team was easy and professional. All of my surgeries have exceeded my expectations| and I was up and running in no time. This doctor has an incredible skill for reading MRI's and patient's symptoms and is right on target every time! I have one more surgery scheduled for my second hip impingement| and I know I won't be disappointed with the outcome.�,5
371,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�So I am a cement/concrete finisher and use my hands| arms| and knees on a daily basis. I have been suffering from shoulder pain for months.

373,Todd J. Molnar| MD,�I just wanted to thank you for your careful thoughtfully done shot. It was clear that you pout in the extra effort to be sure it was administered where it would do the most good. I have a motto Make someone's day| catch them doing something right. I just did. Happy Holidays.�,5
374,David M. Auerbach| MD,�This was a great doctor. He took the case that was started by another surgeon. After removing pins from the elbow| and releasing the requirement for ongoing casting or splints| complete healing occurred without the need for physical therapy. The doctor's assistant| Amy| was responsive| attentive| and able to arrange appointments around very busy schedules. We had a great experience.�,5
375,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�My name is Laine and I had a double knee replacement done four months apart with Dr. Mark Schamblin late in 2014. Mark and his team (Leslie Lucero and Janelle Gatling) were absolutely fantastic. I have never experienced the personal and professional attention from any other medical facility. From the start| Janelle was on top of every aspect of my surgery and was quick to respond to any and all of my concerns. Leslie has been a fantastic partner in my continued recovery. Mark has continued to follow up on me to check on my progress and performance post surgery. I can't begin to explain my gratitude for this team of caring and professional medical associates. I have referred many friends and family to this group because I sincerely believe they have your best interests at heart. - Laine M.�,5
376,Todd Shapiro| MD,�From my first to the last appointment| the staff at SCOI made me feel very comfortable. My diagnosis & prognosis was explained to me in a precise and clear manner. All staff treated me politely and professionally.�,5
377,Todd Shapiro| MD,�I went to my general doctor who thought I would need surgery to take care of my shoulders which had weakened over time. I did a stint at therapy and he did a cortisone shot. It was ok but did not work. I went back he recommended I go to your practice. Todd analyzed my injury and told me we should try cortisone again and therapy| this time he go the cortisone in the exact location and pain went away of course. I did therapy and strengthened my shoulders and over time my strength has gotten much better| very little pain and no surgery. I am pleased and will continue my exercises daily to keep my shoulder strength up to keep the pain away.�,5
378,Todd Shapiro| MD,�We had a WONDERFUL experience with the healing of 2 broken arms (Both kids broke their right arm 3 weeks apart). I couldn't have asked for better care of my babies. Dr. Shapiro and his assistant Carrie were both extremely caring and made me feel comfortable that their healing process was just as it should be. My daughter's break was pretty bad and the reassurance and detail explanation of how young bodies work to heal made me feel at ease that we would not have problems later down the line. Both casting and X-ray staff made the kids feel comfortable and safe when getting/removing casts and getting images. Thank you to all of the SCOI staff for such wonderful care.�,5
379,David M. Auerbach| MD,�Had my thumb operated on and from the first visit to the last the doctor & his staff were very professional| friendly & to the point of taking care of me. I wouldn't go anywhere else.�,5
380,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I had meniscus repair and ACL revision/replacement surgery on my right knee. From beginning to end Dr. Bahk and the staff--from intake to nurses to the anesthesiologist team--were| and continue to be| exceptional in terms of communication| courtesy| and professionalism. The results have been phenomenal; I literally had no need for pain medication afterwards. I was off crutches in 6 days and 9 days after surgery I was using a stationary bike and an elliptical machine. At this writing| I'm exactly 4 weeks post-surgery. I walk without a limp| have nearly full flexion| I'm back to swimming 3x a week| gym 3x a week| and handling the outdoor ranch chores. I couldn't be happier with the results of this surgery. I unhesitatingly recommend SCOI to anyone I speak with who's looking into orthopedic issues. This group really has their act together.�,5
381,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�My surgery experience and recovery process for my TKR were better than I expected. I had great results and I will refer Dr. Hernandez to others as well as come to him when it's time for my other knee.�,5
382,Steven A. Schopler| MD,�Amazing. I have had issues walking for years. I was told by two doctors I had Progressive MS. I have been to 5 back doctors who wanted to give me a shot in my spine for the pain they said I had| but I didn't but mildly after standing too long. All of them went by MRI's. Dr. Schopler| before my first appointment with him| took an X-ray of my spine| standing up| the first one ever| and there it was one disk way out of line and another less so. Dr. Schopler is my hero| his diagnosis made so much sense| having been a dressage rider for years| and I have hope now I will not spend the rest of my life disintegrating into a bedridden pile of bones. THANK YOU DR. SCHOPLER!!�,5
383,Richard J. Spelts| DO| FAAFP,�Dr. Spelts is a very experienced and caring physician. I saw him for arthritis in my right hip and he sent me for physical therapy with cortisone administered by a patch. After several physical therapy visits the hip pain has almost completely subsided. My other issue was pain in my right shoulder after a fall two years prior. I had seen a physician and a chiropractor| all to no avail. After Dr. Spelts examined my shoulder he felt I had a torn rotator cuff| but it was necessary to have confirmation by an MRI. He ordered the MRI and sure enough| he was correct| in that I had a large complete tear. He referred me to Dr. Michael Bahk in their group| a shoulder specialist. I underwent surgery six weeks ago and I continue to improve. Because of these wonderful physicians| I am now on the road to recovery. I can't thank them enough. I would highly recommend SCOI to anyone with an orthopedic problem. Their offices are extremely efficient and well run. This experience was beyond expectation.�,5
384,A. Elizabeth Bloz�| MD,�It was over 14 years ago that I first received treatment from Dr. Bloz� for my spinal stenosis and she was been great. I still haven't required surgery! Other SCOI experiences include total knee replacements done by Dr. Marc Friedman 6.5 years ago that have been wonderful and elbow treatment by Dr. Lynch. Until my knees required replacement| Dr. Karzel provided excellent treatment. Dr. Karzel recommended Dr. Friedman so I also thank him for that.�,5
385,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I saw Stacey the nurse practitioner. I usually do not think much of NP| but Stacey was amazing... she knew exactly what to do| took 55 cc out of my knee| and gave me a shot of Triamcinolone using an ultrasound machine...and it was like a miracle... I had a new knee. She was efficient| knowledgeable| caring| I was most impressed with her...and so was a friend that came with me! I have now moved to Reno| NV| but am toying with the idea of coming all the way back to CA in June to see her and get another shot.�,5
386,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I am a 44-year-old with bad hips. I used to jog several miles a week for exercise and to clear my mind. A few years ago| I started experiencing pain in my hips. I thought maybe I was overdoing my running. But I continued to run| just not as far. Last year is when I realized I had enough of the pain. I saw 4 different doctors. I was given shots and had taken medication but was still in pain. I was told I was too young for hip replacements. Finally| I went to SCOI. I saw Dr. Gazmarian first then he sent me to Dr. Hernandez. SCOI staff are on top of everything! I had my surgery set up in 2 weeks. It went very well. Dr. Hernandez checks in with me to make sure I'm doing ok. The care and professionalism is top notch. I am so glad I have been in Dr. Hernandez and his staff's care. Dr. Hernandez is amazing! Thank you so much for giving me my life back!�,5
387,A. Elizabeth Bloz�| MD,�Dr. Bloz� was very encouraging and supportive. At first| it appeared that I would need surgery for my stenosis.

389,Jonathan S. Jaivin| MD| FACS,�I came to know SCOI as a result of a reconstruction surgery my son had on his shoulder. I was so impressed with the results and care that when my feet started giving me fits| I researched a doctor at SCOI. Dr. Jaivin was the only one that just worked on feet so I figured he has to be the best for me. I was not wrong. My first experience was when Dr. Jaivin operated on both feet for Tarsal Tunnel. My experience was amazing. I had no post-operation pain. Prior to the operation| I was a virtually crippled. With this operation| both feet are pain-free from this issue.�,5
390,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I tore my ACL during a training for my job. I was referred to the Southern California Orthopedic Institute by my Workers Compensation adjuster for treatment.

Reception staff were courteous| professional| and concerned with my privacy. My wait in the lobby was minimal and the Nurse/Tech who came to get me was thorough in confirming the problems I was experiencing and what to expect during this visit. Everything was explained to me| step by step| and they asked if I had any questions or concerns. Doctor Getelman entered the examination room after a brief wait| introduced himself and confirmed my complaints. He then proceeded with a very thorough examination| ordered X-Rays (onsite)| then ordered an MRI to confirm my torn ACL. Treatments & Prognosis were discussed| then we proceeded with the agreed upon treatment and Physical Therapy. With the suggestions and follow through treatments| I am much better off than I was when I was injured. Too bad I couldn't give you 6 stars.�,5

They explained in detail about my diagnosis; I never felt rushed through my appointment and will definitely keep them as my providers (Etcheverry and Shapiro) THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR AWESOMENESS!! I most appreciate that the both of you are very well aware of CrossFit and help me recognize what I need to do to keep my feet and elbows strong| healthy| and in place in order for me to function effectively in the box...YOU GUYS ROCK!!�,5
402,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�The best now and twenty years ago.�,5
403,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�Great doctor. I had heard great things about Dr. Hamilton and was thankful that he did my surgery. He took time to explain in detail pre and post surgery my condition with my knee. I would absolutely recommend Dr. Hamilton.�,5
404,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�Dr. Hamilton and his staff are the best| I was very scared to undergo surgery. They made me feel relaxed and well taken care of. The follow-up emails to check up on me were very helpful. The center is very clean| there is just a peaceful feeling.�,5
405,A. Elizabeth Bloz�| MD,�It was over 14 years ago that I first received treatment from Dr. Bloz� for my spinal stenosis and she was been great. I still haven't required surgery! Other SCOI experiences include total knee replacements done by Dr. Marc Friedman 6.5 years ago that have been wonderful and elbow treatment by Dr. Lynch. Until my knees required replacement| Dr. Karzel provided excellent treatment. Dr. Karzel recommended Dr. Friedman so I also thank him for that.�,5
406,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�I saw Stacey the nurse practitioner. I usually do not think much of NP| but Stacey was amazing... she knew exactly what to do| took 55 cc out of my knee| and gave me a shot of Triamcinolone using an ultrasound machine...and it was like a miracle... I had a new knee. She was efficient| knowledgeable| caring| I was most impressed with her...and so was a friend that came with me! I have now moved to Reno| NV| but am toying with the idea of coming all the way back to CA in June to see her and get another shot.�,5
407,Todd J. Molnar| MD,�I have used Dr. Todd Molnar for many years and under his care have managed to avoid surgery. Todd always tries to find the conservative approach. In treating my knee injury| he prescribed the series of shots which seems to have solved the problem four months later. His physician assistant| Brian| was particularly conscientious and thoughtful in explaining what he was doing and giving injections. He did such a good job on the last one that I wrote an email. it is my philosophy to 'make someone's day| catch them doing something right' and I did and told him so. I have recommended Dr. Molnar and his staff to others and have also spoken to others who have had Brian do the same injections with the same care and attention. � Carl J.�,5
408,Paul M. Simic| MD,�During the initial consultation| Dr. Simic took the time needed to get a complete health history as well as discussing the reason for seeking his care. Thorough examination and extensive testing were completed prior to recommending surgery. The pre-operative| surgery and post-operative appointments were scheduled. Dr. Simic's team answered all my questions in a professional| prompt and extremely friendly manner. I would highly recommend Dr. Simic| his team and SCOI to take care of your ortho needs. � Isabel L. �,5
409,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�I severely tore my rotator cuff and came to Doctor Stephen Snyder at SCOI for help. After 14 months of thinking the injury would heal itself| according to my primary care person| I requested to have an MRI done and took it to see him. I have complete trust in Doctor Snyder as a shoulder doctor| from a previous condition| and only wished I would have thought to see him sooner. And as suspected the injury was going to require surgery to correct. Doctor Snyder explained everything to me from the condition| cause| repair| pre-surgery| post surgery| physical therapy| and the most important consideration| that I might be in the water again surfing in 6 months. I felt completely assured making the decision about treatment. Without the intervention| my life became a stand still. I couldn't exercise| surf| dive| run| anything. I have to say Doctor Snyder did a wonderful job. And I'm not saying that because I've heard it said he's the best shoulder doctor in the country| but from the pictures and video he showed me pre/post| especially the picture of the repaired area. He did a magnificent job and I owe him a huge debt. To tell you the truth everything about going to see Doctor Snyder at SCOI was exceptional. His staff| Maria and the physician assistants| made the experience go smoothly. The doctor I saw there for my pre-surgery clearance was through and most understanding. And the surgical staff and facility were beyond talented| human| and state-of-the-art. To see Doctor Snyder coming to me while I sat recovering from surgery| to personally adjust my shoulder sling was| to say the least| most heart warming. But they say the truth is in the pudding. The picture I have included is me diving in Fiji the week before last| about five days short of 6 months post surgery.�,5
410,Kamil Erfanian| MD,�Everyone was courteous and friendly. A very professional staff. I have been here before and had a good experience. No question an A+ operation.�,5
411,Christopher D. Hamilton| MD,�I injured my shoulder in 95 while serving as a line corpsman with the Marine Corps. It went undiagnosed for the next 15years. Before my last deployment to Afghanistan in 2010 is when I finally found out why my shoulder was always bothering me. I was told at the time that the damage was done and I couldn't further injure myself. They were wrong! haha After I retired I decided to get it looked at and maybe it was time for a tune up. Well here I am 10 weeks postoperatively and there is light at the end of the tunnel. I believe I will be back to it in no time. Nothing but the best to say about the care I have received during this experience. From my surgeon to the operating room and clinical staff. I know what I am talking about because I worked in and was in charge of three operating rooms during my 20 years in the Navy. I'm not 100% yet| but feel I will be soon. Thank you all very much! � Michael H. �,5
412,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Dr. Jaime Hernandez and Dr. Paul Simic are both very caring and considerate of their patients and most willing to accommodate their physical temporary inabilities through physical and occupational therapy recommendations and treatments.

416,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Dr. Hernandez was very professional and thorough with my care! I needed to have a partial knee replacement due to arthritis on the underside of my knee cap from repeated dislocation. Dr. Hernandez spent quite a long time with me discussing the pros and cons regarding this procedure. While I was I the office during my initial visit he was on the computer and telephone discussing the options with colleagues and looking as to what was available on the market that would be the most reliable for my particular knee. I was very confident with his knowledge and ability to fix my knee so that I can have a more normal life without pain.�,5
417,David M. Auerbach| MD,�Extremely good surgeon. My son had a terrible and very challenging broken elbow. Dr. Auerbach took on the surgery with all it's difficulties and did an AMAZING job. Much gratitude to Dr. Auerbach as well as his employee Amy. She has the patients of a saint. I'm not easy to deal with when it comes to one of my children. She was on top of everything and very efficient at what she does. Thank you both!�,5

422,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�After suffering an 18-millimeter tear in my left rotator cuff I visited Dr. Schamblin who explained the entire process and showed me with their state of the art technology what to expect and explained in detail the surgical procedure and recovery process. I can honestly say other than 2 or 3 days of discomfort following the surgery I was literally pain free and I feel my mobility is coming back ahead of schedule special thanks to Dr. Mark Schamblin all of his staff and everyone at the Southern California Orthopedic Institutes Bakersfield California location for their high level of expertise and quality care. Thank you.�,5
423,Gregory J. Hanker| MD,�Luckily mine was not a serious injury but Dr. Hanker spent enough time with me each visit and gave me good explanations about what had occurred. I followed his orders completely and my finger is as good as new!�,5
424,A. Elizabeth Bloz�| MD,�Prompt| accurate| caring| detailed while being understandable.�,5
425,Deborah A. Casta�eda| MD,�Dr. Castaneda was direct| knowledgeable| professional| pleasant and personable and no nonsense! I have nothing but good things to say about her and all the treatment I received at SCOI. Would recommend you folks anytime to anyone. Thanks for all you do.�,5
426,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�Dr. Snyder performed surgery on my rotator cuff in October 2015. He has always done a remarkable job. I have trusted him with my orthopedic care for years and have never been disappointed in his professional demeanor and skills. He is an excellent surgeon and his bedside manor is top notch. My rotator cuff has healed and I have returned to doing all my activities.�,5
427,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�I saw Dr. Ferkel for a second opinion after another doctor at a different medical group suggested I needed bilateral knee surgery. Dr. Ferkel explained that my condition is complicated by psoriatic arthritis and that it would be best to get this condition under control first. He also indicated that it was doubtful I needed bilateral knee surgery. He took the time to discuss these things with me and explained them very effectively and logically. I am also receiving physical therapy @ SCOI. The physical therapist| Dale| has helped my knee and back conditions immensely. I feel fortunate to have such a great medical group near where I live and work.�,5
428,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�Dr. Snyder and his entire staff are very professional| caring| and Its been a pleasure being his patient. Wouldn't go anywhere else for orthopedic treatment.�,5
429,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�DR. GUANCHE IS AMAZING!!! I was severely injured at work and had many injuries including a nasty shoulder injury. My first doctor (whom I won't name) didn't notice that my shoulder was dislocated for 7 months!!! It was outrageous. He was only taking X-rays from one direction. So after he FINALLY got the MRI report back| he realized that my shoulder was much worse than he thought. Since my shoulder was dislocated for so long and never detected| my bones had ground down and were no longer a properly working rotator cuff! He wasn't comfortable doing the repair| so he sent me to Dr. Guanche who is an expert with this type of injury. I am so grateful that he sent me to Dr. Guanche because my first doctor repaired my ankle (which was severely broken) and it was not done very well at all| especially compared to the precision work that Dr. Guanche does. Right away| Dr. Guanche relieved my concern by telling me he could fix my shoulder. He informed me that I would need a shoulder replacement surgery. His team of nurses (Bianca and Lillit) did an excellent job with following up with the workers' compensation rep to get my surgery done. Workers' compensation always takes SO long| but they were persistent and stuck with it. They got my surgery scheduled faster than any of my other workers' compensation surgeries by far. Dr. Guanche did a tremendous job with the surgery and I am so happy with my progress now. I had the surgery about a month ago and I'm on the way to a full recovery. There was minimal swelling afterwards and the incision looked like something a plastic surgeon would have done. I am in pain| but that is to be expected. I have tattoos all over my arms and shoulders and Dr. Guanche said he would try and line my tattoos up as best as possible. Which he did| there's barely a scar!! I am in physical therapy now and although it's too early to say if I am going to be back to 100%| I can say with honesty that Dr. Guanche is the best surgeon I have ever received care from. He is kind| professional| easy to talk to and is punctual| which is usually unheard of in the medical field. I suggest to anyone reading this to have Dr. Guanche do your surgery and assist you in healing. He is the best!!�,5
430,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�He is so caring and treats me like family.�,5
431,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�I have had three rotator cuff surgeries with Dr. Snyder| he is the most compassionate| thorough| competent doctor I have ever experienced. I would not hesitate referring Dr. Snyder to anyone with shoulder issues which I have done and will continue to do.�,5
432,Fadi S. Saied| DO ,�Great doctor.�,5

436,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I tore my rotator cuff and bicep tendon. I had a successful surgery by Dr. Bahk. Dr. Bahk and all of the staff at SCOI were great| always friendly and professional. I also did my therapy at SCOI and you could not ask for a better group of therapists to help you get through a tough time. I have seen other doctors at SCOI and I would recommend this group very highly. Thanks again for all you do! � Dan C. �,5
437,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I was referred to Dr. Bahk by a co-worker who had been treated for the same injury I had| (torn meniscus). My experience with Dr. Bahk and his staff| which includes SCOI physical therapy| has been excellent. From day one| I was treated with respect| care| and genuine concern for my well-being. Dr. Bahk is knowledgeable| caring| comforting| and I felt confident in his abilities| after doing some research and meeting him in person. He informed me of my condition and my options| when I opted for surgery| he assured me he could help me. On the day of surgery| Dr. Bahk and his surgical staff made me feel at ease. The surgery went well| I'm 5-weeks post op and recovering as expected. I highly recommend Dr. Bahk! Thank you| Dr. Bahk and to all your staff.�,5

439,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Dr. Hernandez was the best doctor I've seen in a long time. Spent time talking me explaining and chatting. Very funny| personable man who seemed to really care about my issues. He promised I'd be good as new in now time and he was right. Three weeks later I was back teaching yoga. By 6 weeks out| I was definitely so much better off than before surgery. He and his staff are very nice.�,5
440,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�Every once in a while the universe provides�and that's precisely what happened to me. I tore my Achilles' tendon| but waited too long to get treatment. I decided to seek an opinion at the SCOI Van Nuys Saturday morning clinic. They did X-rays and I was told I needed surgery to correct the problem. I was also told that I was fortunate because the best orthopedic surgeon in the world worked in the building. I'm Canadian| so the notion of paying for a medical procedure is a foreign concept. Even before meeting Doc Ferkel (Sr.)| the staff at SCOI were friendly and knowledgeable and were always quick to answer my questions regarding the logistics of my circumstance. I read a lot online about Doctor Richard Ferkel before my first consultation. I even listened to an interview he did regarding his NBA patient Joel Embiid. Then it happened... I read that Doc Ferkel is a drummer. Suddenly I knew I'd be ok. I earn my living from music and in live situations I am a drummer. The tendon I hurt is on my kick drum foot which is essential to playing drums. From my first appointment| Doc Ferkel has made sure regaining my ability to perform was of primary importance. The procedure he used in surgery was specific to my needs and his attention to detail in recovery has made me feel like everything will be ok. After an operation| 6 casts| crutches| and an air cast I am on the mend. I look forward to meeting the people in physiotherapy at SCOI as I am positive they too are professionals of the highest order. Thank you| Doc Ferkel and SCOI for giving me the beat back! �,5

442,Paul M. Simic| MD,�Dr. Simic is congenial| knowledgeable and thoughtful about the level of treatment.

467,Christopher D.

The entire Hamilton Team very helpful| personable and attentive to my questions and concerns I am grateful to Kerry Ryan who helped me find Dr. Hamilton and felt comfort that he understood my triathlete mentality as well as understood my desire to maximize my recovery to not only work without pain but resume my normal personal activities When I encountered challenges getting Worker's Comp to authorize pain meds post surgery - Megan and Mr. Brennan helped me navigate the waters of the process The only challenges I have encountered have been with Worker's Comp and SCOI| Megan| Mr. Brennan and staff remain PHENOMENAL!!

472,David M. Auerbach| MD,�Sure| SCOI is a high-volume enterprise| but there's no escaping the sheer excellence of the place. Waits were minimal. Yes| it took a while for Dr. Auerbach to show up to do my procedure| but I have absolutely no quarrel with it. Sometimes stuff involving the patient in front of you in line just takes longer than anticipated. I appreciate the fact the doctor didn't give that patient short shift. It could'a been me! Dr. Auerbach was approachable and friendly. From top to bottom| the staff was reassuringly professional. Though I am not yet fully recovered from the surgery and my injury| it is plain that the surgery was done to the highest standard. Even the waiting room was good. The live trees in the lobby were analogous to the extremities that SCOI specializes in. The trees were healthy. They were growing. So| by extension| will soon be the extremities of we the patients. � Edward M. �,5
473,Todd J. Molnar| MD,�I just can't say enough good things about SCOI. Every person who works there is kind| helpful| competent| friendly and really seems to like their job.

481,Babak Barcohana| MD,�Before meeting Dr.Barcohana I had been shuffled around to various surgeons who thought would take my case and I felt very vulnerable to something I would regret. So I went online and found Dr. Barcohana who was part of the surgeons team at SCOI| and once reading his bio| accomplished medical journals| his previous patients reviews I knew he was the one to help me. My initial evaluation consisted of X-ray| MRI| motor skills and pain level analysis before he indicated that I was in need of surgery ASAP. He had diagnosed me with 3 ruptured discs| torn nerve which caused a drop foot that interfered with my gate. I couldn't imagine having lumbar surgery but knew from what I was experiencing that it was what I needed. My surgery took place March 15th| 2016| and had taken 4 hours to complete. Dr. Barcohana indicated he succeeded in repairing my spine and now It was my task to take part in rehab| physical and aquatic therapy to regain my motor skills and strength. It's now mid-May and I'm on a roll to recovery with no back pain| walking with no assistance but still with some partial paralysis due to the drop foot which is improving daily with continuous physical therapy. I'm very thankful to Dr. Barcohana| his assistant Ester Kishimoto and the team at SCOI in taking part in helping me recover from my spinal injury and their professional dedication.�,5
482,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�I have never experienced a more professional attentive and genuinely caring group from the reception to the doctor have all left me eternally loyal. My surgery was also a magnificent success! Thank you and God Bless all of you.�,4
483,Steven A. Schopler| MD,�After dealing with many issues that arose after a l5/S1 disc herniation I was referred to SCOI and Dr. Schopler. From the initial visit to the post op visits| I have never had such an amazing experience. Dr.Schopler and the entire staff treated myself and my wife with a genuine passion that is rarely seen today. The engagement after surgery from the staff made us feel as if my well-being was important to them. Myself and my family thank you for your outstanding commitment to my recovery. � Don M. �,5
484,Steven A. Schopler| MD,�I needed emergency surgery as a result of two ruptured discs in my neck. The medical options were disc fusion or disc replacement. With only a day to investigate my options I requested replacements. Unfortunately| fusion had already been approved by my insurance and I needed to get into surgery asap. I filed an appeal but before I got my answer| I was 4 plus hours under the knife. The following morning Dr. Schopler told me I had the largest impingement he had seen in his many years. It was so big he took a picture of it with his phone. He indicated the discs came out beautifully and there was no significant damage or bruising to my spinal cord. He then said I stopped the surgery and told my staff we have an issue here. Our patient is a perfect candidate for disc replacements but his insurance has yet to approve them. He looked at me that morning and said| I told them we were going to do what's in the best interest of our patient and I put in the disc replacements. I can not express my appreciation and gratitude for the decision he made. Nothing is more personally meaningful and words just fall short. That is character| that is gumption| that is the highest level of care and professionalism. To be taken care of in a manner that is in my best interest when I was so helpless to take care of myself| I am forever in his debt. I am a Probation Supervisor. I have worked for the Department for 20 years and the last 15 years I have been a lead instructor teaching officers self-defense| arrest and control| cell extraction| and gun retention. Disc replacements have given me back my range of motion| allowed me to return to teaching without the excessive wear a fusion would have on the disc above and below the fusion| and brought me as close to 100% as is possible. Thank you| Dr. Schopler! I tell my story to all I know and to a person each says| now that's the kind of doctor I want.�,5
485,A. Elizabeth Bloz�| MD,�I came to SCOI because of a severe pain in my right hip. After meeting with Dr. Bloze| she believed that my discomfort was caused by Spinal Stenosis and a nerve was being pinched. She ordered an MRI and it was performed at the Santa Clarita facility. When I returned for the results| Dr. Bloze looked at the MRI and after listening to my symptoms once more| and my belief that the pain was more local to the hip joint| she agreed to give me an injection of corticosteroids. Her decision was based on the MRI results| her professional experience with others| and my input. The treatment relieved my pain| and made my sleep more restful. I appreciate her willingness to listen to the patient| and consider their opinion in the prescribed treatment.�,5
486,Todd Shapiro| MD,�Everything went really well with my shoulder surgery. The staff made the whole experience very comfortable. � Emma P. �,5
487,John L. Etcheverry| DPM,�I recently had surgery on a broken foot at the Bahamas surgery center. Everything went well from the prep before| the surgery| and even the after care.

502,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�Dr. Schamblin repaired a torn meniscus in my left knee this past May. I had the same surgery performed on my right knee two years ago by a different surgeon.

I feel confident that my surgery will come out fine just like the last one. Dr. Auerbach has helped save my hands. I like how Southern California Orthopedic Institute operates. I have also had both my knees replaced there. Dr. Friedman did an excellent job. Also| the physical therapy department is excellent. I highly recommend Southern California Orthopedic Institute for orthopedic work.�,5
506,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�My right shoulder was injured in 1992| operated on twice (not by SCOI) and I was told they could do no more to help my shoulder| and I'd have to live with pain the rest of my life. In 2015| I found Dr. Guanche and SCOI. I had a reverse shoulder replacement surgery| a somewhat new procedure and only mastered by a few doctors. Dr. Guanche is the only doctor in this universe I would trust to perform this surgery. After only 5 months| I am basically pain-free and am able to perform tasks that I was unable to do for 20 years. I'm 69 years old| and sorry I didn't find Dr. Guanche much earlier.�,5
507,Steven A. Schopler| MD,�I have seen 3 different doctors at SCOI � Dr. Schopler| Dr. Hamilton| & Dr. Erfanian. My experience with each of the doctors was wonderful.

508,William H. Mouradian| MD,�Always a pleasure to have a doctor that listens to you.�,5
509,Todd Shapiro| MD,�I was referred to Dr. Shapiro after having my shoulder broken in a workman's comp. case. Dr. Shapiro| his PA Carrie Alejandro| and their staff were professional and skilled in their interactions with me. I rarely had to wait beyond my appointment time and was seen by one of them not long after I was taken into an examination room. They both spent| what I felt like| adequate time with me to determine how I was doing and to answer any of my questions. I felt that they provided excellent care to me. I felt that they tried many different things before it became necessary for me to have surgery. My surgery experience was also wonderful; as wonderful as having surgery can be. I was very impressed with all of the pre-surgery steps that occurred. The use of the Patient Portal to prepare me for what I should do pre-surgery helped to relieve my concerns. When I had a question| it was answered within a few hours. The surgery center itself| and the staffthere| were outstanding. The use of the Patient Portal after surgery also helped me to know what was happening was usual and how to address anything that arose. Again| any question I had was answered in a very quick manner. I have been so impressed with Dr. Shapiro and his staff. Although I would prefer not to have to visit the office again for an injury| I know exactly where I will go should something arise.�,5
510,William H. Mouradian| MD,�I was very informed about everything that was going to happen to me. Dr. Mouradian is a very nice and straight foward doctor| which I like.�,5

512,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�I am a professional manager and I am thoroughly impressed with Dr. Hernandez's intelligence| skill| and staff.

I have recommended him to two friends -- one who needed a knee replacement| which was done| and one who had complications from an old surgery years ago. Dr. Hernandez was able to tell her exactly what she needed to do and she was pleased with his opinion.�,5
513,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�Dr. Jamie Hernandez is the most professional and caring doctor that I have ever been to in my life!!! He reconstructed my knee and leg that another doctor messed up!!!! He is an amazing doctor!!! I have referred a lot of people to him. I could hardly walk when I came to him... They immediately scheduled surgery to fix my knee & leg. The surgery worked. My leg was 10 degrees out and my knee was put in sideways by previous surgery by another doctor the X-rays are before and after... He made my knee & leg| straight as it should have been in the first place. He is very compassionate and has excellent bedside manner. If you need surgery that needs to be reconstructed| go to Dr. Jamie Hernandez. It will be done right!!!!! He is an awesome Doctor!!!!!!!

519,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�Dr. Guanche figured out rapidly what was wrong with my hip. The other Dr. was not able to figure it out and he looked at the same MRI! He is just amazing leaving such a small scar and had done a lot of work!�,5

522,William H. Mouradian| MD,�I was sent to Southern California Orthopedic Institute for a Workman's Compensation case to see Doctor Mouradian as the AME in my case.

The Staff and the Doctor at SCOI made it a pleasant experience in such a difficult time.�,5
523,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�I am a 52-year-old male. I spent the majority of my 40s as an electrician laborer| using many impact power tools. Impact power tools can transfer many stresses from the hand to the upper extremity elbow and shoulder joints. I used these tools repetitively for many years. I endured right shoulder pain for approximately the last 5 years. This pain was experienced as a sharpness that occurred during certain ranges of arm motion that involved| in particular| overhead reaching or lifting. After the work day| the pain was intensified during sleep time wherein I would typically awaken 4 to 5 times a night due to discomfort in the right shoulder joint. I am also a competitive Jump Rope participant. The shoulder pain was an impediment to my workouts and was clearly interfering with the success of my Jump Rope routines. About a year before my surgery| I started treatment under the care of a massage therapist who worked at a chiropractic clinic. While the massage therapy effectively improved my right shoulder flexibility and range of motion| it failed to address the root cause of the sharp pain that I continued to experience. After 1 year of massage therapy| the chiropractor referred me to SCOI where I would be under the care of Dr. Ronald Karzel. At SCOI| through x-ray and MRI diagnostics| it was determined that I had a large sub acromial bone spur that likely caused impingement upon my rotator cuff and bicep tendons. The MRI clearly showed a large tear in the supraspinatus tendon. This is the tendon associated with the motion that involves raising the arm. Being diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff tendon| at first| seemed like an alarming or even scary experience| but I intuitively went with Dr. Karzel's recommendation to proceed with a rotator cuff repair surgery - this was determined to be the best course of action for my particular situation. The surgery experience was very positive| and was completed in 1 afternoon at the Van Nuys facility. The Van Nuys staff was competent| kind| professional| and respectful of my personal dignity. I elected to have a nerve block which eased and facilitated the pain management after surgery. I am 3 months out of surgery as of this writing. For me| the recovery process has been very positive. I was fortunate that I only required 1 day of pain meds| however I did maintain regular use of ice packs on the surgical site for at least 2 1/2 weeks with occasional use every few days since then. The recovery process involved daily follow up with the SCOI office via emails until the first 4-week post op office visit. I actually returned to my desk job after 2 1/2 weeks post-op| maintaining my arm in the arm sling and performing only simple desktop computer work. I became an expert at using the mouse with my left hand. After 2 months| I began physical therapy at the SCOI Valencia Office. The physical therapy has challenged me to increase my flexibility and range of motion. The physical therapy is performed in a comfortable| gym-like environment| and the staff is cheerful| competent and qualified - I can honestly say I have daily measurable improvement in range of motion. The physical therapy process will continue as I approach month 3 of my recovery and will move into more strengthening exercises. Overall| I will say the entire diagnostic / surgical / recovery / rehabilitation process has been successful| continues to be successful| and has exceeded my every expectation. I have even been able to resume my jump rope activities. I am very satisfied with Dr. Karzel and the SCOI team| and I gratefully endorse their services.�,5
524,Patricia C. McKeever| MD,�Dr. McKeever is the best. She has been treating our baby for hip dysplasia since birth. We trust her immensely and have always appreciated her interactions with our daughter. As new parents| it has been hard to see our baby in a harness but we have had great support| advice| and encouragement from Dr. McKeever. We are grateful.�,5
525,Fadi S. Saied| DO ,�I'm a first-time patient in 2016. Can't tell you how much I appreciated the service of both Dr. Saied and his assistant Melissa| I believe. I had X-rays taken ahead of time so real information could be given to me during my visit. Melissa also provided me with great customer service.�,5
526,Fadi S. Saied| DO ,�Dr. Saied is the best. Very professional and very straight forward and very kind. He replaced both my hips in 2015 and did an excellent job. When I was referred to him by Dr. Hamilton| I had congenital hip dysplasia in one hip and one leg was a full inch shorter than the other. I had been limping for years. I had gone through three knee surgeries performed by two non-SCOI doctors in the past who never even checked my hips. The chronic limping resulted in deterioration of the other hip as well. Dr. Saied replaced both hips over the course of six months and changed my quality of life tremendously. I have and will continue to recommend him to friends| family and colleagues.�,5
527,Fadi S. Saied| DO ,�I have had severe pain in both knees. When I left his office| I was virtually pain free.�,4

Everybody in the clinic| helped a lot| dealing really nice and being very patient. It was a great experience| now I'm recoveringfor the second surgery but I really fell good. Thanks so much for being such a nice group.�,1
530,Kamil Erfanian| MD,�Dr. Erfanian is amazing! He explained in detail my options and all risks involved and together we came up with a solution that worked for me. His amazing surgical skills ensured I have full use of my hand!�,5
531,Todd D. Moldawer| MD,�Dr. Moldawer was the first Ortho who treated me in almost 15 years. My last Ortho passed away then and I haven't had a back doctor since. Dr. Todd treated me very kindly and respectfully| and spent time with me too. I feel confident he will take care of me whenever a need for surgery become necessary in the future. The Staff is also kind and professional| going out of their way to make sure we are content with our treatment. I really scored on this Group.�,5

533,Gregory J. Hanker| MD,�I was really scared to get my surgery done| scared in a sense of the results. But Doctor Hanker made me feel secure with cases similar to mine and he's long years of experience I thrust him I'm a really happy patient ..THANK YOU!!�,4
534,Richard D.

537,Kamil Erfanian| MD,�I was seen and treated by Trisha Lacey for a painful nodule that was in a ligament in my hand| causing a trigger thumb.

545,Stephen J.

Dr. Shapiro injected the cyst and it did wonders| I was able to get around and no pain| but the pain came back so I saw Dr. Shapiro| they did x-rays and that knee has deteriorated so my much since last year| Dr. Shapiro was going to inject the cyst again| but where the pain is now there isn't a cyst| it's on the right side back of my knee| now it's the left side back he said the pain was caused by a spur that has developed and that I was going to have to look seriously at having surgery| he did inject my knee to see if that will help for a bit until I can have the surgery. But what I like so much was that Dr. Shapiro understood how I felt and worked with me to relieve the pain with out surgery and he is such a caring person and he listens to his patients and the staff at SCOI are wonderful| polite and helpful. I have recommended SCOI and Dr. Shapiro to many.�,5
556,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�Dr. Snyder had a conservative approach which I appreciated. No other doctor actually viewed all the layers of my MRI with me| explaining the anomalies he spotted that were worthy of note.

It is about 3 and 1/2 years since my right shoulder surgery and I am thrilled with the results. � Lisa L. �,5

577,Stephen J. Snyder| MD,�Not only was Dr. Snyder and his team professional| the clinic from in-take to post surgery care was seamless and honestly beyond my expectations.�,5
578,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�I sing Dr. Bahk's praises to everyone I know| just yesterday someone said they needed a second opinion about a shoulder injury and I piped up his name. Then I realized I had never officially rated him. So here I am. I give Dr. Bahk five stars! I went to Dr. Bahk twice. Once when I broke my ankle in 3 places and he did the surgery. And once when I had a frozen shoulder. Orthopedic events are never fun. They take a while to heal and it can be really frustrating for the patient. But Dr. Bahk's kind nature and his orthopedic expertise saw me through both events. He thoroughly explained the options available to me and was very patient and answered all my questions. Currently| I am thankfully pain-free and able to walk and use my arm with no impediments. Thank you| Dr. Bahk. P.S- You guys also have a lovely Van Nuys Physical Therapy Department.�,5
579,Michael S. Bahk| MD,�Excellent doctor. Did the cortisone shot perfectly.�,4
580,Eric I. Ferkel| MD,�The less than optimum (even catastrophic) experiences with previous surgeries at the hands of other doctors at other hospitals and facilities caused my husband and myself to become hyper-vigilant in looking for any red flags whenever we visit a doctor out of necessity. This can lead us to read more into a situation than it merits. Everyone was very understanding| patient and gracious and we appreciate the high level of professionalism throughout our experience at SCOI.�,5
581,Babak Barcohana| MD,�I came to SCOI in 2009 with a ruptured disc. Dr. Barcohana delivered what he promised! He fixed my back using minimally invasive surgical techniques. I am happy to say that I am without pain and doing very well. The staff at SCOI was professional and helpful in every way. I would and have recommended Dr. Barcohana and the SCOI team to friends.�,5
582,William H. Mouradian| MD,�I had spine surgery about 6 years ago. Dr. Mouradian is a wonderful doctor and surgeon. He and his office staff here in Ridgecrest always had time for me. Everything was explained and they had a way of making you feel comfortable about having this major surgery. Over the last few years I have recommended Dr. Mouradian and SCOI to several people. Thank you for being there for my surgery needs.�,5
583,Babak Barcohana| MD,�Dr. Barcohana did a successful c spine fusion on me years ago. I cannot say enough about the level of care I received from him and his entire staff. I would not hesitate to refer anyone I know in need to him in the future. He is top notch!�,5

586,Ronald P. Karzel| MD,�My hats off to Dr. Karzel| he saved my hike of a lifetime. I was a thru hiker on the PCT| (Pacific Crest Trail| Mexico to Canada) and suffered severe pain on the outside of my left knee. Basically unable to walk. I had to take a pain pill to walk eight miles to the highway to get to the ER in Lancaster on a Saturday. At the ER my left leg was completely immobilized and I was put on crutches and referred to SCOI. On Monday I showed up at SCOI| did the paperwork and because of my situation| (homeless as I was hiking) I was able to see a PA. I told him this appointment basically would determine my fate as to whether or not I would be able to continue my hike to Canada. I was given an MRI and seen by Dr. Karzel who explained my condition and it was determined my new orthodics were the problem. The right one had a lift in it which put pressure on the left leg. I was given an injection in the left knee and two weeks later was back on the trail. Awesome experience. Thanks Dr. Karzel and SCOI.�,5
587,Jaime D. Hernandez| MD,�The best doctor that I have ever met. The entire staff is outstanding.�,5

592,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�Both Lesley Lucero and Mark Schamblin had been there for me. From the first time I came into my first week after my surgery| I have nothing but the utmost respect for them.

594,Richard J. Spelts| DO| FAAFP,�Hi Dr Spelts - I just wanted to let you know that I did Ironman Chattanooga Sunday. I finished but didn't make the cut off time| but I'm still counting it as a finish. The bike was 4 miles longer| and I only had 16| not 17 hours to finish. It was also 95 degrees. The best thing is| I was able to run at least some of the run| and my knee still feels good today. Thank you for all your help!�,5

604,David M. Auerbach| MD,�Dr. Molnar treated my aching back in 2014. Dr Auerbach fixed my broken finger in 2015. Dr| Spelts took care of me when I got a concussion in 2016.

605,Brian S. Grossman| MD,�From my very first call| to my post op appointment| I couldn't be more pleased with the staff at SCOI group| as well as Dr. Grossman.

607,Paul M. Simic| MD,�I have had several opportunities to use the services of SCOI and each one has been quite successful. The latest visit endured for about a year and the doctor was Dr. Paul Simic. Wow| it was far beyond words that I can find to tell you how pleased I was with the kindness and consideration of his mannerism and care. He took care of my every whim personally such as; I had some fears about anesthesia and he had input with the young men who did the injection using Ultra Sound and I was greatly impressed with how smoothly everything went. His staff was equally caring and efficient in taking care of me. I felt like they modeled what Dr. Simic expects from those who take care of his patients. He is the kind of doctor I wish everyone could have because it gives the patient such peace going into surgery| to know just how intensely he cares. He should teach a class on patient-physician rapport. I will be back should I need your services again.�,4
608,Carlos A. Guanche| MD,�I was treated by Dr. Guanche for frozen shoulder. He listened to me and answered my questions completely.

642,David M. Auerbach| MD,�The experience I had at SCOI was great. I arrived a few minutes early and was immediately given forms to fill out. As soon as those were completed I was moved into another room where the history was taken. When that was completed I was sent back to the waiting room but only for a couple of minutes. I was then taken into the examining office. An x-ray technician came in immediately to take me to the x-ray room| where x-rays were immediately taken. I then went back to my room and only waited a minute or two before the doctor came in. The examination was thorough and received good feedback on my medical problems. Upon completion I had been there approximately an hour| maybe longer however only a couple minutes of that was waiting. I am very impressed and would recommend this group and every one of the very professional people I interacted with| from the receptionist to the x-ray tech to the nurses and doctor.�,5
643,A. Elizabeth Bloz�| MD,�I have seen Dr. Bloze for some 20 years and will continue to see her as long as she is in business and I have a need for her services. I insist that any and all nerve conduction tests and studies be done by Dr. Bloze as she has found problems with my body that have been missed by others. Thanks to her my neck fusion as extended to include more vertebrae than anticipated by my surgeon because of Dr. Bloze's knowledge of my history| and complete and thorough dedication to the well-being of her patients. Altho a 4 disc cervical fusion was not something I was looking forward to| I am grateful she caught the problem before I had surgery or a 2nd surgery would have been required. Regardless of where my referring physician is| I INSIST that Dr. Bloze do my nerve conduction studies and always will. It is with complete confidence that not only do I continue to be a patient| I whole heartedly refer her to others.�,5
644,Mark L. Schamblin| MD,�The staff is always very courteous and friendly. The care provided for my daughter was always top-notch during her pre-op| surgery| and post-op. I would highly recommend them.�,4

654,Kamil Erfanian| MD,�SCOI has helped me to get to the bottom of my hand issue. I was referred by my primary Dr trying to solve a painful| weak hand that she and I couldn't solve alone. It was a work issue as well so double situation. I had been turned away other Drs. Once I got started at SCOI/Bakersfield my tests were ordered and I got some in depth answers for my hand issues. Dr Erfanian has been extremely helpful with a listening ear- so appreciated. This gave me the tools I needed to prove that I really had a work related issue and that I needed health care. Thank you SCOI for your very professional organization�,3

656,Fadi S. Saied| DO ,�My experience with the physician and his assistants was very positive. Nice people and explained to me in clear terms the problem I had. Overall| a good experience.�,5
657,Mark H. Getelman| MD,�Last year I had some problems swimming| and I found out I had a right shoulder rotator cuff that was disconnected . Dr. Gittleman was able to use orthoscopic surgery to reconnect the tendons that were being shredded by my bone spur on my shoulder. The surgery went very well I was able to use the power of my right arm pool hard during the Australian crawl in swimming. Recently I found out my left shoulder was having the same problem| so I scheduled some surgery for that. Meanwhile we found out that I had some sophisticated cardiac problems that had to be taken care of. So in effect of using blood thinners for that procedure I have to wait six months to get my left shoulder fixed. I'm quite sure that will be taken care of with the same excellent professional orthoscopic surgery as before. When I was talking to my cardiac doctor who had the same rotator cuff surgery but not by orthoscopic means he really felt sorry for me that I had to go through such surgery| but in Dr. Gttleman's hands I think I will have very little difficulty with his noninvasive procedure. Thanks for all the people at SCOI?�,4
658,Richard D. Ferkel| MD,�Very positive experience. Had to wait longer than I anticipated| but the care and the overall experience was exceptional. Dr. Ferkel is extremely professional and very thorough. I feel like I am in great hands.�,4

I am progressing well and a lot faster to recovery than I ever thought possible. I actually look forward to meeting him for an appointment rather than the dread of going to the doctor's office. Thanks much for your attention to detail. Cheers| Dan�,5

673,Brian S. Grossman| MD,�Dr. Grossman is the best doctor. If you have problems with your back he is the doctor that will take care of you. I just had surgery 2 weeks ago and I could not be happier. He put a big smile on my face. The pain that I had is completely gone. Besides some scheduling problems I would recommend Dr. Grossman. He is knowledgeable and knows what he is doing.

674,Fadi S. Saied| DO ,�Friendly| efficient| thorough staff and Doctor.�,5
675,Jonathan Falakassa| MD,�Did two epidurals that were not helpful. Referred to Dr. Jonathan Falakassa. From start to finish through ALIF surgery on L-5| Dr. Falakassa has been superb in every aspect of care. Recovery has been (expectedly) difficult| but Dr. F has been there every step of the way...evaluating and providing personalized care. Even providing me his personal text number. On a scale of 1-10 he is off the chart...10| 12??? You have a gem there. Please provide him every recognition and opportunity for advancement. P.S. FYI| I NEVER give 10's on surveys.�,4

2,Aaron J. Balgaard| M.D.,�I was 100% satisfied with the treatment I received from Dr. Balgaard. He was upfront and honest about the outcome he felt I would see if I opted for shoulder surgery vs. natural healing. I went with natural healing. I think I regained almost full range-of-motion with my shoulder. Dr. Balgaard always took the time to answer any questions I would have at my appointments. He is professional. I felt the entire staff at Heartland Orthopedic Specialists were professional and expedient in moving me through my appointments.�,5
3,Aaron J. Balgaard| M.D.,�I broke my arm this past summer. I was referred to Dr. Balgaard. He discussed the options of surgery or natural healing for my situation.

At all appointments| he took time to answer any questions I had. I felt that he did an excellent job in handling my medical needs. I would highly recommend Dr. Balgaard to anyone needing guidance or surgery for an orthopedic injury.�,5
4,Emily J.M. Monroe| M.D.,�In September I found out I would need surgery on my knee. It turned out to be a little more extensive of a procedure than I was hoping for with a longer recovery than anyone ever wants! I am usually the caretaker| not the who needs to be taken care of. From my very first appointment with Dr. Monroe| I knew I was in great hands. She always entered the room with a smile. She always sat down and made eye contact while talking and was never in a hurry. I was still allowed time for questions and was ever offered to call with any needs or concerns. This was my first experience personally with Heartland Orthopedic Specialists| and I was so impressed on how kind everyone was to me from checking in| to the staff who brought me to my room| and of course Dr. Monroe. What a great addition you have made to your group of surgeons. In the most vulnerable of times| I was made to feel at ease and handled very well cared for.

6,Siegfried (Sig) Feierabend| M.D.,"�Four weeks ago I had an anterior hip replacement performed by surgeon| Dr. Feierabend at Heartland. I no longer need a walker or a cane. For me| an anterior hip replacement meant faster recovery without as many precautions and fewer pain meds. I have only used over-the-counter pain medicine since I was discharged from the hospital. I am now cleared to ""do anything I want to do."" I am looking forward to long| pain free walks which I have not been able to do for some time. Anterior hip replacement might not be the answer for everyone| but it well worth looking into.�",4
7,Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,�The care I recieved in the hospital after my total knee was excellant all the nurses were so kind and understanding! I had the best care you can get while I was there and Dr. Nelson was also very kind and professional.

8,Jefferson C. Brand| M.D.,�Dr. Brand is Great! He was professional| and very concise with his plans for my knee repair. And the staff have always shown their care for my individual situation.

14,Timothy E. Lindley| M.D.| Ph.D.,�Dr. Lindley was so easy to talk to and his whole staff is amazing. They took a very scary condition and made it seem a lot less scary. They all listen to my questions and answered them so I could understand. They asked me questions and listen to my answers too. You don't get that everywhere. I really felt like I and my family mattered to them.The hospital care staff that took care of my after surgery were great too. They seemed to really care about me. I was so grateful to everyone that I gave them all cookies for Christmas.�,5
15,Timothy E. Lindley| M.D.| Ph.D.,�Exceptional in every way!�,5

20,Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,�Dr. Dudley is an extremely caring physician with a wonderful personality. Dr. Dudley takes time to analyze results and when he provides his conclusion it is concise and explained in a manner that is easily understood. Dr. Dudley ensures that one is comfortable with the outcome and is always willing to answer questions. A little over two years ago he operated on my wife who had sustained a comminuted fracture of the wrist and this past summer he attended to our grand child's broken wrist. (Runs in the family I guess). I would highly recommend Dr. Dudley to anyone.�,5

26,Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,�Dr Weigel was on call when I ripped my shoulder apart. He was very gentle| polite and compatent. He did a very fine job in caring for me| through healing process.�,5
27,Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,�I fractured my left patella and severed anterior ligaments in the process. Dr Eric put me back together again.

32,Timothy E. Lindley| M.D.| Ph.D.,�I found Dr Lindley to be very professional and caring. I had a lot of questions and he took the time to answer each and everyone of them. Never making me feel like I was being rushed. I was always so nervous about having any surgery done to my neck| but he assured me he had done this particular surgery many many times. After talking with him I understood exactly what had to be done and scheduled my surgery. Both my surgery and recovery went really well. I did as I was told following Dr's orders to the letter| and this helped my healing immensely.�,5
33,Timothy E. Lindley| M.D.| Ph.D.,�Dr. Lindsey went over and beyond helping me with my severe pinched nerve.�,5
34,Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,�I have been doctoring with my foot/ankle since April| with another foot doctor. My daughter suggested that I should get a second opinion. Since I had knee replacements at your hospital and I am a patient of Dr. Dale| I called for a appointment with your Foot Doctor. What a wonderful Dr. Sticha is| he knew what was wrong with my foot in about 10 minutes| had X-rays that confirmed his diagnosis. Put me in a brace for Adult Aquired Flatfoot.

Professional| knowledgeable| courteous| concerned| personable| are the words that come to mind when I think of Dr. Weigel and his team. I could not have been in more capable hands. Tuesday and Thursday the following week| Dr. Weigel performed extremely successful surgeries to clean up a staph infection in my knee. FYI: The origin of the infection was not a knee replacement or other clinic/hospital related event. I have found my orthopedic specialist for any future need.�,5
48,Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,�I needed to have shoulder surgery and Dr. Wiegel told me what he had to do and what I should expect on recovery.�,1
49,Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,"�All my experiences with Heartland Orthopedic Specialists and Alomere Health have been extremely satisfactory. Everyone I saw at both places was helpful| kind and caring. I had double knee replacement at Dr. Dudley's suggestion and am so glad I did it that way. Dr. Dudley did one knee while Dr. Dale did the other| so I didn't have to be in surgery for an extended amount of time. The surgery wasn't a ""horrible"" experience| but I am glad I only had to do it once! I would--and have--recommended Heartland Orthopedic Specialists and Douglas Co. Hospital to others.�",5
50,Paul A. Dale| M.D.,�I had limited expectations. I needed the hip pain to go away. Guess what it is gone and I am forever grateful. I am having a new experience every day. I have Freedom from Pain.�,5
51,Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,"�Dr. Nelson has repaired numerous arthritic joints for me. I have always found him to be professional| competent and caring. He suggests surgery as the last resort and actively tries to find non-evasive solutions. I have had very little pain from his procedures and his ""seamstress"" abilities have left me with minimal scarring. He is a great addition to the heartland facility and I have| and will continue to recommend him to others. ps. The entire staff of heartland| from the doctors| therapists| hospital staff etc have been outstanding.�",4

55,Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,�I was very pleased with Heartland Orthopedic Specialists � I was able to see a doctor quickly| appointment was on time and doctor diagnosed problem immediately. The doctor was also very informative and assured me to return if there were future problems.�,5
56,Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,�We both have had knee replacements and George a hip replacement of which are very pleased with and would highly recommend Heartland Orthopedic Specialists. Shirley had Doctor Brand years back when broke my arm and that too was a success still wearing the pins put in. The therapy we both have received too was well worth it. �,4
57,Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,�Everyone was wonderful| starting with the admitting through my discharge. I can not say enough about the wonderful care through the process of my second knee replacement. The first knee replacement was the previous year and it went so well and again the great care of everyone| made it very easy to decide to do the second a year later on 2-4-16. It was amazing to stand the first time after surgery and have no pain like I had been having before the surgery. Of course I was given medications for the pain that I could have and I am sure the nerve block helped as well| but through my whole recovery I honestly can say I have had very little pain| mostly just some stiffness that the exercises help with. Thank you so much for taking care of me!�,5
58,Paul A. Dale| M.D.,�Hip replacement very well. Very pleased. From start to finish| they informed me of everything that was going on. Surgery went well| therapy| and follow up visits.�,5
59,Paul A. Dale| M.D.,�The nurse and Dr. Dale were both very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. I was happy to be able to schedule my second knee replacement surgery and make the necessary arrangements.�,4
60,Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,"�Having moved to Alexandria 6 years ago| I have become Dr. Eric Nelson's ""poster child"". Arthritis has taken its toll and he has replaced a knee| a hip| and a shoulder for me. He will do the other shoulder the end of April. I have found Dr. Nelson and the orthopedic staff to be friendly| competent| and caring...take it from me... I should know!!! Dr. Nelson looks for other methods of relief before surgery. He encourages one to seek alternate methods if one can find relief. He uses surgery as the method of last resort. I have encouraged others to see Dr. Nelson. Heartland clinic is a major economic development boon to Alexandria. Keep up the good work!!�",5
61,Paul A. Dale| M.D.,�Very satisfied with Dr. Dale and Heartland Orthopedic Specialists as well. Very impressive program before| during hospital stay and post op care. In need of another surgery and plan to come there again.�,5
62,Paul A. Dale| M.D.,�My questions were always answered. The hip surgery was completed and the therapy was very helpful. I was so pleased that coaches were allowed in and shown how to help the patient.�,5
63,Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,�On December 3| 2015 I fell just outside my door at home. I damaged my left rotator cuff which required surgery. Dr. Nelson showed great concern over my problem. He kept my daughter informed about the surgery and after the surgery was completed. He also showed compassion during my one-month check-up with him.�,5
64,Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,�He was absolutely wonderful. His visits were non rushed with answering all questions I had. More importantly had a smile on his face and very pleasant bedside manner.�,5
65,Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,�Great experience| excellent Doctor. Will have services if needed any time here. Everyone from front desk to all staff great job.�,5
66,Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,�I had X-rays on both of my thumbs and they both showed extreme rheumatism. He gave me cortisone shots in both thumbs and they have been doing really well! Thanks to Dr. Nelson!�,5
67,Jefferson C. Brand| M.D.,�Rotator cuff repair. Very good follow up very good.�,5
68,Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,�Very informative about health issue I have. Willing to answer all the questions that I had. Pleasant to talk to.�,5
69,Paul A. Dale| M.D.,�When I found I would need reversed shoulder replacement| I was given the choice to see Dr. Dale or go to the cities. I decided to visit with Dr. Dale first. He was very thorough from examination to a complete explanation of the surgery and what was to follow| even to the detail of bringing an extra pillow along to assist in my ride home from the hospital. I felt totally comfortable with Dr. Dale and said this was where I should be. He continues to be thorough and caring about my care and recovery. I am so thankful I decided to stay with my local hospital and doctor. I believe I got more personal care than I might have gotten in a larger facility.�,5
70,Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,�I have had very positive experiences with Heartland specifically Dr. Sticha. The entire staff treated me with kindness and professionalism when I had surgery on my left foot (5th metatarsal) and my triple ankle fracture on the right side. Surgery is never a pleasant experience but the Heartland staff answered my questions or concerns| handled me with kid gloves and gave me excellent care. It is a well-run office as I never had any trouble getting into to see the doctor and there was virtually no wait time once I checked in. Dr Sticha even came out to talk to me after I had left his office when I remembered I had another question. My ankle was broken in Arizona and the flight home to have Dr. Sticha perform the surgery was worth the discomfort and effort. I wanted the surgery to be in Alexandria with Sticha and it worked out well for me. I would recommend Heartland to anyone. Thanks.�,5
71,Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,�After almost two years| one previous surgery from another provider and visits with multiple doctors I had lost hope. I couldn't fathom living with the pain I had been experiencing the last two years for the rest of my life. Then I met Dr. Sticha and the staff at heartland orthopedic specialists. These folks are amazing! Turned my life around! The most knowledgeable| friendly| helpful| dedicated and talented medical professionals I have ever been treated by. Dr. Sticha is a superhero in my book!�,5
72,James E. Andrews Jr.| D.O.,�VERY good Doctor with best results I've gotten so far! I appreciate the way he listened and made a decision that gave me relief and possibly a long-term solution.�,5
73,Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,�I had been experiencing severe pain in my right knee for many year. Finally| a little over a year ago my primary Doctor asked me if I wanted to be referred to an Orthopedic Doctor| it was agreed and then I was asked where I wanted to be referred to| I said Heartland as I knew several people who had replacements there| with good experiences. One year ago I had my right knee replaced| this year I had my left knee replaced| both experiences were very good.�,1
74,Paul A. Dale| M.D.,�Everyone I talked to recommended I come to Alomere Health for my hip replacement surgery because everyone here is so professional. I found that to be true. The care I received after the surgery was exceptional. The nurses who got me up and walked with me immediately after surgery could not have been better. The surgeon did an excellent job. I would highly recommend this place.�,5
75,Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,�I felt totally confident and safe with my doctor that he was doing what was best for me. Everyone treated me with respect and kindness and gave me the best care I could of ever wanted.�,5
76,Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,�I couldn't have had better care anywhere else. My doctor and the surgery rehab staff are terrific. Thank all so much.�,5
77,Paul A. Dale| M.D.,�Dr. Dale has replaced both of my hips and now one of my knees| and he has always been very kind and explained everything before and after the surgery| so I always knew what to expect.�,5
78,Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,�I have nothing but praise for both Dr. Weigel and the entire staff of Heartland Orthopedic Specialists. I have been a patient for my feet| both shoulders for rotator cuff surgery| and my most recent a total knee replacement| which I am in the process of recovering from. It is great to have this kind of facility in Alexandria and to have the great doctors here to handle all of the issues that can come up.�,5
79,Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,�Doctor has always given me his educated options| and I have never felt pressured into surgery. He also discouraged me from surgery once when he thought it was not needed. Had me try another option and it worked well. Also have had surgery on my feet by another doctor at Heartland Orthopedic Specialists| and he was very good| and I got a good result.�,4
80,Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,�I saw Dr. Dudley in May| and it was determined that I needed trigger finger release surgery for BOTH of my thumbs. The staff in Alexandria was very helpful for me to determine if I should do both surgeries at once considering my high deductible insurance. I opted to do both at the same time| and I was very glad that I did| the surgeries took care of the problem| and I was glad to have my recuperating time cut in half by taking care of both hands at one time. Little did I know that I would have ANOTHER trigger finger! So| back I went| and I just had the third surgery now in November. I was able to get my surgery scheduled quickly and make the follow-up appointments before we leave for Florida in January.�,5
81,James E. Andrews Jr.| D.O.,�He has been the best since day one wouldn't go to anyone else. Listens and answers my question whether bad or good. Let's me know my options.�,5
82,Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,�From the first meeting with Dr. Nelson and into postsurgery| we have been impressed with the entire process. All appointments were completed in a timely fashion. Preoperative instructions from the manual to the meeting were informative and very helpful. The check in was seamless. Postoperative was handled efficiently and with care. Hats off to the entire staff for creating an almost pleasant experience. My recovery has gone according to the book| due in large part to my wife. She is a physical therapist. That's the good news. The bad news is that she is a physical therapist! But we managed to get through the tough parts with little yelling| and we are still together. I would recommend your organization.�,5
83,Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,�I got right in on time. They were courteous and gave a good explanation of problem and treatment.�,4
84,Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,�I had constant pain in both my shoulders. I was referred to Heartland Orthopedic Specialists for shoulder replacement surgery. Dr. Nelson was my surgeon. Now| I don't have any pain and they feel great. I'm back to work now and don't have any problems. I would recommend Heartland Orthopedic Specialists and Dr. Nelson to anyone who has shoulder pain. It was a great experience for me. Everybody at Heartland Orthopedic Specialists is very nice and friendly. I would do it again. Thanks Heartland Orthopedic Specialists and Dr. Nelson.�,5
85,Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,"�I made a career change 4 years ago to a more limited and flexible schedule to provide time for my passion| downhill skiing. Unfortunately| a year ago| knee pain was a part of my ski routine. The pain was not unbearable but enough to influence where I would ski and made the experience not what it should be. I had both knees scoped| meniscus surgery tx last fall| and I now ski 4-5 days a week at the ""Biggest Skiing in America-Big Sky| MT.� I am a mountain host/guide 2-3 days a week and give tours on the mountain to intermediate or higher level skiers. I also just finished a ""master of the mountain "" course offered by the ski school to advance my ski skills| where we covered difficult terrain and skied off the top of the mountain at 11|106 feet with a 4000-foot vertical drop. The goods news| I have been able to ski more difficult terrain| pain free. Sometimes| orthopedic care doesn't involve a major ligament tear or trauma but things just need tweaking to allow a person to enjoy their passion for athletic sport. Keep up the good work at Heartland Orthopedic Specialists. Enjoying the ski season at Big Sky Montana.�",5
86,Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,�I scheduled a knee replacement to be done on Oct. 15| 2013. I had a knee replacement done on my other knee nine years before. I had had a very easy recovery that time and was told that I could consider myself a poster child for knee replacement. I was a little nervous about this one| now being in my later 50's. Dr. Dudley said that he and his team would do their best for me. That they did! Not only very little pain| I walked with a walker that evening| and without crutches 8 days later. I surprised my therapist by being able to go all the way around on the stationary bicycle at my first rehab therapy visit 6 days after surgery. The team I had was very professional and reassuring. They made my first appointment for rehab| which was very nice as I had to make my own the first time and was told I had to wait. I am looking at having some new parts for my first replacement replaced and would not consider having anyone else. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best| Dr. Dudley and his team receive an 11. Thank you!�,3
87,Paul A. Dale| M.D.,"�This is my second joint replacement in 10 years. Dr. Dale performed each replacement. The first was a hip replacement in 2003 and the second was a total knee at Thanksgiving of 2013 and it was a great way to get out of cooking Thanksgiving dinner! Your staff and facilities are top of the line. Dr. Dale is a wonderful and very personable surgeon! I recommend Heartland Orthopedic Specialists to everyone I know! I recently had a nurse who works at a therapy care center tell me that they can always tell which patients had surgery at your facility and those who do not. ""When they come from Heartland| they WALK in. When they come from somewhere else| they come in a wheelchair!� All of you should be proud of your record! It's been two months and I'm back to normal!�",4
88,Paul A. Dale| M.D.,"�Osteoarthritis hurts! It changes your life by preventing you from enjoying activities you have done all your life. The pain becomes constant and you can't remember taking a walk with out pain. Dr. Kennedy was the first to inject my knee with cortisone. I always told him he worked magic. I would go about 6 months pain free. In 2006| I took a trip to China. Twice| while site seeing| I had to pay someone to push me in a wheel chair and I wrapped my knee in a heating pad at night. That's when I made the decision to have my total joint replacement. It truly is a miracle. I tell people it's like being ""born again."" Dr. Dale did a great job. I must give Lance the credit for keeping me mobile these days. My left knee has deteriorated and needs replacement| but I haven't had the time to take for the recuperation. It truly does take two months to get back from surgery. Lance is a great care provider. He explains everything| never makes you feel rushed| and gives the injection like a pro. I always highly recommend Heartland Orthopedic Specialists and have referred numerous people to Dr. Dale and Lance.�",5
89,Paul A. Dale| M.D.,"�""Dr. Dale has fixed my shoulders and more recently removed the pain I had with a problem with my hip. I am so thankful for him. My shoulders were so painful that I couldn't even wear my coat. I had to get something lightweight to wear until he fixed them. I am so thankful. I tell everyone who asks me about my surgeries how they helped. I am so thankful for Dr. Dale."" -- Dorthy K.�",5
90,Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,"�""I went to what was my final follow up after what I consider to be my quickest recovery of any of my previous surgeries. Dr. Weigel was amazing.

91,Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,"�""I was having serious pain in my right shoulder. Dr. Weigel replaced my left hip seven years ago. I went to him to see what my shoulder problem may be. Testing showed a torn rotator cuff and a torn bicep tendon. My hip replacement has been so good that I had confidence Dr. Weigel could restore the use of my shoulder. The surgery went well. I've started rehab and am having great results. I'm excited to see the use of my shoulder coming back to me! Thank you| Dr. Weigel and the whole Heartland Orthopedic Specialists staff!"" -- Ray S.�",4
92,Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,"�""I was having carpal tunnel issues. Dr. Nelson took great care of me through the entire process. He fixed me up and I was good as new within minutes after my surgery. Three days after my surgery| I started using my hand and began to regain strength right away. I was glad I didn't have to wait forever to use my hand again. I didn't have to take any time off of work. It�s been a little over a month and my hand feels amazing. The strength is getting better each day."" -- Ashley N.�",4

94,Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,"�""I came to see Dr. Dudley with a long-standing compensation case for my left knee. I realize that I will need a knee replacement in the future. Since we just moved into this area| I decided to find a doctor that would be able to do this when I was ready. Dr. Dudley was very professional and upfront with me| indicating what my choices are and what time frame I have to work with. I appreciated his candor."" -- Harry M.�",4

97,Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,"�""Heartland Orthopedic Specialists is great! I made an appointment in May with Dr. Dudley| after my knees had been hurting for the past two years after walking a mile| and after an MRI he found a medial meniscus tear in my left knee. Surgery was done the end of June| which went great| and physical therapy started. After three weeks I was back to my nightly three mile walk without any pain| and almost six weeks later I was back to my 10 mile nightly bike ride| after my walk. So great to peddle a bike again| without pain in my knee. I would refer Heartland Orthopedic Specialists to anyone who asks| and have been telling people that if they have problems| make an appointment. Everyone is great there| from the front desk| to the nurses| to the doctors. They are all so friendly and they really care about you. I hope I never have to use them again| but if I do| that's where I'm going. Thank you all for the awesome care you gave me!!!"" -- Shirley D.�",5
98,Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,"�""I made an appointment to find out about pain I was experiencing in my ankle. I thought perhaps it was coming from the bunion that had been changing over several years. I had heard good things about Dr. Sticha| but had never met him. What I liked the best about him was that he was straight-forward| told me what the problem was| and that it might help to have sole supports in my shoes. He wrote up the prescription for them and I was done. No mess| no fuss. That's the way I like it!!!! Thank you and I would definitely return if I have any other orthopedic issues."" -- Diane A.�",4

It didn't hurt until the next day and then it was on a Saturday and so I waited until on Monday to call my doctor and he had an X-ray taken and told me that I had arthritis in the shoulder| so he gave me a prescription filled. This went on for over a month. I went back to the doctor and told him that I wanted to see a specialist. So he got me an appointment with Dr. Weigel. He gave me a shot in the shoulder and said to try that. Well I called him in a week and I got another appointment with him| and he suggested surgery.
