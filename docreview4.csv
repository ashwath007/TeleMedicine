Doctor,Review
Aaron J. Balgaard| M.D.,“My results and possible treatment options were explained well.”
Aaron J. Balgaard| M.D.,“Dr. Balgaard was very thorough| explained what was going on and what would be happening. He was very kind and caring. The whole process with the joint replacement class| the notebook filled with questions| answers| exercises| everything I needed to know about knee replacement was addressed. Caring professionals staff heartland Orthopaedics Specialists| and we are so very blessed to have them in our community. Thank you!”
Aaron J. Balgaard| M.D.,“I was 100% satisfied with the treatment I received from Dr. Balgaard. He was upfront and honest about the outcome he felt I would see if I opted for shoulder surgery vs. natural healing. I went with natural healing. I think I regained almost full range-of-motion with my shoulder. Dr. Balgaard always took the time to answer any questions I would have at my appointments. He is professional. I felt the entire staff at Heartland Orthopedic Specialists were professional and expedient in moving me through my appointments.”
Aaron J. Balgaard| M.D.,“I broke my arm this past summer. I was referred to Dr. Balgaard. He discussed the options of surgery or natural healing for my situation. I felt he presented this information in a concise manner which helped guide me in my decision. I opted for natural healing. I am extremely happy with the outcome. At all appointments| he took time to answer any questions I had. I felt that he did an excellent job in handling my medical needs. I would highly recommend Dr. Balgaard to anyone needing guidance or surgery for an orthopedic injury.”
Emily J.M. Monroe| M.D.,“In September I found out I would need surgery on my knee. It turned out to be a little more extensive of a procedure than I was hoping for with a longer recovery than anyone ever wants! I am usually the caretaker| not the who needs to be taken care of. From my very first appointment with Dr. Monroe| I knew I was in great hands. She always entered the room with a smile. She always sat down and made eye contact while talking and was never in a hurry. I was still allowed time for questions and was ever offered to call with any needs or concerns. This was my first experience personally with Heartland Orthopedic Specialists| and I was so impressed on how kind everyone was to me from checking in| to the staff who brought me to my room| and of course Dr. Monroe. What a great addition you have made to your group of surgeons. In the most vulnerable of times| I was made to feel at ease and handled very well cared for. I also want to thank Dawn who prepped me for surgery. I was fighting back the tears the whole time| and she was terrific! Brandon and Scott in PT are the best! Thanks| everyone!”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“Dr. Dale was fast| efficient and professional! He was very skilled and had an excellent bedside manner. He answered my questions. I had confidence going into surgery that all would go well.”
Siegfried (Sig) Feierabend| M.D.,“Four weeks ago I had an anterior hip replacement performed by surgeon| Dr. Feierabend at Heartland. I no longer need a walker or a cane. For me| an anterior hip replacement meant faster recovery without as many precautions and fewer pain meds. I have only used over-the-counter pain medicine since I was discharged from the hospital. I am now cleared to "do anything I want to do." I am looking forward to long| pain free walks which I have not been able to do for some time. Anterior hip replacement might not be the answer for everyone| but it well worth looking into.”
Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,“The care I recieved in the hospital after my total knee was excellant all the nurses were so kind and understanding! I had the best care you can get while I was there and Dr. Nelson was also very kind and professional. If I ever have to get the other knee replaced I would go back to Heartland Orthopedic's again.”
Jefferson C. Brand| M.D.,“Dr. Brand is Great! He was professional| and very concise with his plans for my knee repair. And the staff have always shown their care for my individual situation. My surgery went wonderfully| and I have already felt back to normal| minus a little pain on the same day. Thank you all!”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“I had hip surgery 2 years ago and have no pain now. I go for walks| bowl and have had no problems. Dr. Dale was very helpful with answers to my questions and his care.”
Timothy E. Lindley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“Dr. Lindsey fused several discs in my neck. He was always very professional| while still appearing to be very caring. I also saw his PA Spaeth several|times| and was extremely thankful for his knowledge and pleasant personality!. He ordered a CT scan that found a brain aneurism and most probably saved my life!”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“Surgery was excellent. Still have a good hip. It hurt like hell| but I did all the exercises.”
Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,“Dr. Sticha was amazing. Very nice and personable| was always polite and answered whatever questions I had. I broke my ankle and leg| the surgery went great and my recovery even greater. I haven't had any problems in 2 years.”
Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,“Dr. Nelson always took the time to listen to my concerns and was always professional and courteous. He did a great job with my knee replacement. Pre-op appointments| the day of surgery| and post-op followups went as expected and I couldn't be more pleased with my new knee!”
Timothy E. Lindley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“Dr. Lindley was so easy to talk to and his whole staff is amazing. They took a very scary condition and made it seem a lot less scary. They all listen to my questions and answered them so I could understand. They asked me questions and listen to my answers too. You don't get that everywhere. I really felt like I and my family mattered to them.The hospital care staff that took care of my after surgery were great too. They seemed to really care about me. I was so grateful to everyone that I gave them all cookies for Christmas.”
Timothy E. Lindley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“Exceptional in every way!”

Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“Dr. Dudley is an extremely caring physician with a wonderful personality. Dr. Dudley takes time to analyze results and when he provides his conclusion it is concise and explained in a manner that is easily understood. Dr. Dudley ensures that one is comfortable with the outcome and is always willing to answer questions. A little over two years ago he operated on my wife who had sustained a comminuted fracture of the wrist and this past summer he attended to our grand child's broken wrist. (Runs in the family I guess). I would highly recommend Dr. Dudley to anyone.”
James E. Andrews Jr.| D.O.,“I think I own a room at heartland as I have been there so often. I have always found the personnel to be friendly| efficient and professional. Wait times are minimal and I appreciate that. The doctors have always taken the time to explain things and don't seem to be rushing to get rid of you. At heartland| you are not just a number.”
Siegfried (Sig) Feierabend| M.D.,“Dr. Feierabend is a great doctor! Makes you feel at ease| Very knowledgeable| Great bedside manner I had a total shoulder with rotator cuff repair. It is coming along great due to the excellent care from Heartland. He will be doing my other Shoulder.”

Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,“Knowledgable| clear| engaging. Options for knee pain. Cortizone shots in both knees. It worked! Immediate and lasting relief .”
Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“I appreciate all the care and support that I have been given by Dr. Dudley and all of his staff. When I had my bilateral knee replacement at the Douglas County Hospital| the staff there were excellent as well.”
Timothy E. Lindley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“Dr. Lindley did an excellent job. I would rate him five. I have never had such a great Doctor. He did a great job with my surgery. I would recommend him to anyone.”
Timothy E. Lindley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“He and his team have to be one of the best in the state!”
Timothy E. Lindley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“I found Dr Lindley to be very professional and caring. I had a lot of questions and he took the time to answer each and everyone of them. Never making me feel like I was being rushed. I was always so nervous about having any surgery done to my neck| but he assured me he had done this particular surgery many many times. After talking with him I understood exactly what had to be done and scheduled my surgery. Both my surgery and recovery went really well. I did as I was told following Dr's orders to the letter| and this helped my healing immensely.”
Timothy E. Lindley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“Dr. Lindsey went over and beyond helping me with my severe pinched nerve.”
Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,“I have been doctoring with my foot/ankle since April| with another foot doctor. My daughter suggested that I should get a second opinion. Since I had knee replacements at your hospital and I am a patient of Dr. Dale| I called for a appointment with your Foot Doctor. What a wonderful Dr. Sticha is| he knew what was wrong with my foot in about 10 minutes| had X-rays that confirmed his diagnosis. Put me in a brace for Adult Aquired Flatfoot. The pain is gone and I am able to go on my walks. God Bless you| Dr. Sticha!!!”
Timothy E. Lindley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“Dr. Lindley did the following things that impressed me and reassured me that he was a good choice as a surgeon. 1. We traveled to Alexandria from Moorhead because he came highly recommended by people I know and other medical professionals. I will also recommend him to others...I already have. 2. He spent TIME with me and my husband explaining the type of surgery I would have done. Dr. Lindley answered our questions and we both felt reassured that this was a good decision. 3. I have had such a good recovery and followed all instructions that he and James Spaeth gave to me upon leaving the hospital. I'm not doing cartwheels but have returned to all activities. 4. I have NO PAIN!! He is an exceptional surgeon. Thank you Dr. Lindley”

James E. Andrews Jr.| D.O.,“Good advice and counseling for a bad knee. Appreciate advice to do surgery only when absolutely necessary!”
James E. Andrews Jr.| D.O.,“He listens to me and explains procedures well. He is also likeable”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“My experience from my knee surgery at Heartland Orthopedics went "great" from the start. From my first appointment with Dr. Dale to my 12 week check-up with him. The staff at both Heartland Orthopedic Specialists and during my 3 day stay at Alomere Health were all "very professional". Could not have asked for better care from the entire group. Nice to have such an excellent facility so close to home!!”
James E. Andrews Jr.| D.O.,“I have lower back problems and have several epidural shots overt the last few years from Dr. Andrews. He is always professional. He is always looking for a way to ease my problem. The staff at the hospital has always been very professional and let you know what is happening. All are very caring people. I have often told people about my outstanding treatment and recommended Heartland| Douglas Co Hospital and Dr. Andrews. Thank you very much.”
Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,“Dr. Weigel was on call when I was referred to Heartland Orthopedic Clinic for a knee problem| Friday| June 3rd. Professional| knowledgeable| courteous| concerned| personable| are the words that come to mind when I think of Dr. Weigel and his team. I could not have been in more capable hands. Tuesday and Thursday the following week| Dr. Weigel performed extremely successful surgeries to clean up a staph infection in my knee. FYI: The origin of the infection was not a knee replacement or other clinic/hospital related event. I have found my orthopedic specialist for any future need.”
Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,“I needed to have shoulder surgery and Dr. Wiegel told me what he had to do and what I should expect on recovery.”
Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“All my experiences with Heartland Orthopedic Specialists and Alomere Health have been extremely satisfactory. Everyone I saw at both places was helpful| kind and caring. I had double knee replacement at Dr. Dudley's suggestion and am so glad I did it that way. Dr. Dudley did one knee while Dr. Dale did the other| so I didn't have to be in surgery for an extended amount of time. The surgery wasn't a "horrible" experience| but I am glad I only had to do it once! I would--and have--recommended Heartland Orthopedic Specialists and Douglas Co. Hospital to others.”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“I had limited expectations. I needed the hip pain to go away. Guess what it is gone and I am forever grateful. I am having a new experience every day. I have Freedom from Pain.”
Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,“Dr. Nelson has repaired numerous arthritic joints for me. I have always found him to be professional| competent and caring. He suggests surgery as the last resort and actively tries to find non-evasive solutions. I have had very little pain from his procedures and his "seamstress" abilities have left me with minimal scarring. He is a great addition to the heartland facility and I have| and will continue to recommend him to others. ps. The entire staff of heartland| from the doctors| therapists| hospital staff etc have been outstanding.”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“Again I felt very confident having Dr. Dale do my knee replacement surgery. His help and encouragement both before and after surgery meant a lot to me. He knew I would be happy to hear I could return to therapy in the Grand Arbor pool!”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“Dr. Dale replaced my knee in February 2015. After faithfully following my physical therapy| I have no further pain. In fact| my new knee works better than the original one that is still in the other leg. I am so very happy that I came to Heartland Orthopedic Specialists and had my knee replaced!”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“My experience with Heartland Orthopedic Specialists was very good/excellent. Our community can be very proud of our medical facilities that we have here in Alexandria| along with the medical staff that provide excellent care. I had knee surgery done and had wonderful care from all the doctors and nursing staff at the hospital....and the good food that we had each day too.”
Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,“I was very pleased with Heartland Orthopedic Specialists – I was able to see a doctor quickly| appointment was on time and doctor diagnosed problem immediately. The doctor was also very informative and assured me to return if there were future problems.”
Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,“We both have had knee replacements and George a hip replacement of which are very pleased with and would highly recommend Heartland Orthopedic Specialists. Shirley had Doctor Brand years back when broke my arm and that too was a success still wearing the pins put in. The therapy we both have received too was well worth it. ”
Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“Everyone was wonderful| starting with the admitting through my discharge. I can not say enough about the wonderful care through the process of my second knee replacement. The first knee replacement was the previous year and it went so well and again the great care of everyone| made it very easy to decide to do the second a year later on 2-4-16. It was amazing to stand the first time after surgery and have no pain like I had been having before the surgery. Of course I was given medications for the pain that I could have and I am sure the nerve block helped as well| but through my whole recovery I honestly can say I have had very little pain| mostly just some stiffness that the exercises help with. Thank you so much for taking care of me!”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“Hip replacement very well. Very pleased. From start to finish| they informed me of everything that was going on. Surgery went well| therapy| and follow up visits.”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“The nurse and Dr. Dale were both very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. I was happy to be able to schedule my second knee replacement surgery and make the necessary arrangements.”
Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,“Having moved to Alexandria 6 years ago| I have become Dr. Eric Nelson's "poster child". Arthritis has taken its toll and he has replaced a knee| a hip| and a shoulder for me. He will do the other shoulder the end of April. I have found Dr. Nelson and the orthopedic staff to be friendly| competent| and caring...take it from me... I should know!!! Dr. Nelson looks for other methods of relief before surgery. He encourages one to seek alternate methods if one can find relief. He uses surgery as the method of last resort. I have encouraged others to see Dr. Nelson. Heartland clinic is a major economic development boon to Alexandria. Keep up the good work!!”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“Very satisfied with Dr. Dale and Heartland Orthopedic Specialists as well. Very impressive program before| during hospital stay and post op care. In need of another surgery and plan to come there again.”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“My questions were always answered. The hip surgery was completed and the therapy was very helpful. I was so pleased that coaches were allowed in and shown how to help the patient.”
Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,“On December 3| 2015 I fell just outside my door at home. I damaged my left rotator cuff which required surgery. Dr. Nelson showed great concern over my problem. He kept my daughter informed about the surgery and after the surgery was completed. He also showed compassion during my one-month check-up with him.”
Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,“He was absolutely wonderful. His visits were non rushed with answering all questions I had. More importantly had a smile on his face and very pleasant bedside manner.”
Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,“Great experience| excellent Doctor. Will have services if needed any time here. Everyone from front desk to all staff great job.”
Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,“I had X-rays on both of my thumbs and they both showed extreme rheumatism. He gave me cortisone shots in both thumbs and they have been doing really well! Thanks to Dr. Nelson!”
Jefferson C. Brand| M.D.,“Rotator cuff repair. Very good follow up very good.”
Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,“Very informative about health issue I have. Willing to answer all the questions that I had. Pleasant to talk to.”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“When I found I would need reversed shoulder replacement| I was given the choice to see Dr. Dale or go to the cities. I decided to visit with Dr. Dale first. He was very thorough from examination to a complete explanation of the surgery and what was to follow| even to the detail of bringing an extra pillow along to assist in my ride home from the hospital. I felt totally comfortable with Dr. Dale and said this was where I should be. He continues to be thorough and caring about my care and recovery. I am so thankful I decided to stay with my local hospital and doctor. I believe I got more personal care than I might have gotten in a larger facility.”
Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,“I have had very positive experiences with Heartland specifically Dr. Sticha. The entire staff treated me with kindness and professionalism when I had surgery on my left foot (5th metatarsal) and my triple ankle fracture on the right side. Surgery is never a pleasant experience but the Heartland staff answered my questions or concerns| handled me with kid gloves and gave me excellent care. It is a well-run office as I never had any trouble getting into to see the doctor and there was virtually no wait time once I checked in. Dr Sticha even came out to talk to me after I had left his office when I remembered I had another question. My ankle was broken in Arizona and the flight home to have Dr. Sticha perform the surgery was worth the discomfort and effort. I wanted the surgery to be in Alexandria with Sticha and it worked out well for me. I would recommend Heartland to anyone. Thanks.”
Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,“After almost two years| one previous surgery from another provider and visits with multiple doctors I had lost hope. I couldn't fathom living with the pain I had been experiencing the last two years for the rest of my life. Then I met Dr. Sticha and the staff at heartland orthopedic specialists. These folks are amazing! Turned my life around! The most knowledgeable| friendly| helpful| dedicated and talented medical professionals I have ever been treated by. Dr. Sticha is a superhero in my book!”
James E. Andrews Jr.| D.O.,“VERY good Doctor with best results I've gotten so far! I appreciate the way he listened and made a decision that gave me relief and possibly a long-term solution.”
Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“I had been experiencing severe pain in my right knee for many year. Finally| a little over a year ago my primary Doctor asked me if I wanted to be referred to an Orthopedic Doctor| it was agreed and then I was asked where I wanted to be referred to| I said Heartland as I knew several people who had replacements there| with good experiences. One year ago I had my right knee replaced| this year I had my left knee replaced| both experiences were very good.”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“Everyone I talked to recommended I come to Alomere Health for my hip replacement surgery because everyone here is so professional. I found that to be true. The care I received after the surgery was exceptional. The nurses who got me up and walked with me immediately after surgery could not have been better. The surgeon did an excellent job. I would highly recommend this place.”
Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,“I felt totally confident and safe with my doctor that he was doing what was best for me. Everyone treated me with respect and kindness and gave me the best care I could of ever wanted.”
Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,“I couldn't have had better care anywhere else. My doctor and the surgery rehab staff are terrific. Thank all so much.”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“Dr. Dale has replaced both of my hips and now one of my knees| and he has always been very kind and explained everything before and after the surgery| so I always knew what to expect.”
Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,“I have nothing but praise for both Dr. Weigel and the entire staff of Heartland Orthopedic Specialists. I have been a patient for my feet| both shoulders for rotator cuff surgery| and my most recent a total knee replacement| which I am in the process of recovering from. It is great to have this kind of facility in Alexandria and to have the great doctors here to handle all of the issues that can come up.”
Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,“Doctor has always given me his educated options| and I have never felt pressured into surgery. He also discouraged me from surgery once when he thought it was not needed. Had me try another option and it worked well. Also have had surgery on my feet by another doctor at Heartland Orthopedic Specialists| and he was very good| and I got a good result.”
Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“I saw Dr. Dudley in May| and it was determined that I needed trigger finger release surgery for BOTH of my thumbs. The staff in Alexandria was very helpful for me to determine if I should do both surgeries at once considering my high deductible insurance. I opted to do both at the same time| and I was very glad that I did| the surgeries took care of the problem| and I was glad to have my recuperating time cut in half by taking care of both hands at one time. Little did I know that I would have ANOTHER trigger finger! So| back I went| and I just had the third surgery now in November. I was able to get my surgery scheduled quickly and make the follow-up appointments before we leave for Florida in January.”
James E. Andrews Jr.| D.O.,“He has been the best since day one wouldn't go to anyone else. Listens and answers my question whether bad or good. Let's me know my options.”
Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,“From the first meeting with Dr. Nelson and into postsurgery| we have been impressed with the entire process. All appointments were completed in a timely fashion. Preoperative instructions from the manual to the meeting were informative and very helpful. The check in was seamless. Postoperative was handled efficiently and with care. Hats off to the entire staff for creating an almost pleasant experience. My recovery has gone according to the book| due in large part to my wife. She is a physical therapist. That's the good news. The bad news is that she is a physical therapist! But we managed to get through the tough parts with little yelling| and we are still together. I would recommend your organization.”
Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,“I got right in on time. They were courteous and gave a good explanation of problem and treatment.”
Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,“I had constant pain in both my shoulders. I was referred to Heartland Orthopedic Specialists for shoulder replacement surgery. Dr. Nelson was my surgeon. Now| I don't have any pain and they feel great. I'm back to work now and don't have any problems. I would recommend Heartland Orthopedic Specialists and Dr. Nelson to anyone who has shoulder pain. It was a great experience for me. Everybody at Heartland Orthopedic Specialists is very nice and friendly. I would do it again. Thanks Heartland Orthopedic Specialists and Dr. Nelson.”
Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“I made a career change 4 years ago to a more limited and flexible schedule to provide time for my passion| downhill skiing. Unfortunately| a year ago| knee pain was a part of my ski routine. The pain was not unbearable but enough to influence where I would ski and made the experience not what it should be. I had both knees scoped| meniscus surgery tx last fall| and I now ski 4-5 days a week at the "Biggest Skiing in America-Big Sky| MT.” I am a mountain host/guide 2-3 days a week and give tours on the mountain to intermediate or higher level skiers. I also just finished a "master of the mountain " course offered by the ski school to advance my ski skills| where we covered difficult terrain and skied off the top of the mountain at 11|106 feet with a 4000-foot vertical drop. The goods news| I have been able to ski more difficult terrain| pain free. Sometimes| orthopedic care doesn't involve a major ligament tear or trauma but things just need tweaking to allow a person to enjoy their passion for athletic sport. Keep up the good work at Heartland Orthopedic Specialists. Enjoying the ski season at Big Sky Montana.”
Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“I scheduled a knee replacement to be done on Oct. 15| 2013. I had a knee replacement done on my other knee nine years before. I had had a very easy recovery that time and was told that I could consider myself a poster child for knee replacement. I was a little nervous about this one| now being in my later 50's. Dr. Dudley said that he and his team would do their best for me. That they did! Not only very little pain| I walked with a walker that evening| and without crutches 8 days later. I surprised my therapist by being able to go all the way around on the stationary bicycle at my first rehab therapy visit 6 days after surgery. The team I had was very professional and reassuring. They made my first appointment for rehab| which was very nice as I had to make my own the first time and was told I had to wait. I am looking at having some new parts for my first replacement replaced and would not consider having anyone else. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best| Dr. Dudley and his team receive an 11. Thank you!”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“This is my second joint replacement in 10 years. Dr. Dale performed each replacement. The first was a hip replacement in 2003 and the second was a total knee at Thanksgiving of 2013 and it was a great way to get out of cooking Thanksgiving dinner! Your staff and facilities are top of the line. Dr. Dale is a wonderful and very personable surgeon! I recommend Heartland Orthopedic Specialists to everyone I know! I recently had a nurse who works at a therapy care center tell me that they can always tell which patients had surgery at your facility and those who do not. "When they come from Heartland| they WALK in. When they come from somewhere else| they come in a wheelchair!” All of you should be proud of your record! It's been two months and I'm back to normal!”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“Osteoarthritis hurts! It changes your life by preventing you from enjoying activities you have done all your life. The pain becomes constant and you can't remember taking a walk with out pain. Dr. Kennedy was the first to inject my knee with cortisone. I always told him he worked magic. I would go about 6 months pain free. In 2006| I took a trip to China. Twice| while site seeing| I had to pay someone to push me in a wheel chair and I wrapped my knee in a heating pad at night. That's when I made the decision to have my total joint replacement. It truly is a miracle. I tell people it's like being "born again." Dr. Dale did a great job. I must give Lance the credit for keeping me mobile these days. My left knee has deteriorated and needs replacement| but I haven't had the time to take for the recuperation. It truly does take two months to get back from surgery. Lance is a great care provider. He explains everything| never makes you feel rushed| and gives the injection like a pro. I always highly recommend Heartland Orthopedic Specialists and have referred numerous people to Dr. Dale and Lance.”
Paul A. Dale| M.D.,“"Dr. Dale has fixed my shoulders and more recently removed the pain I had with a problem with my hip. I am so thankful for him. My shoulders were so painful that I couldn't even wear my coat. I had to get something lightweight to wear until he fixed them. I am so thankful. I tell everyone who asks me about my surgeries how they helped. I am so thankful for Dr. Dale." -- Dorthy K.”
Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,“"I went to what was my final follow up after what I consider to be my quickest recovery of any of my previous surgeries. Dr. Weigel was amazing. He always made me feel like I was his only patient. He made sure all my questions were answered before the appointment was done. Thanks to all at Heartland Orthopedic Specialists!" -- Tom D.”
Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,“"I was having serious pain in my right shoulder. Dr. Weigel replaced my left hip seven years ago. I went to him to see what my shoulder problem may be. Testing showed a torn rotator cuff and a torn bicep tendon. My hip replacement has been so good that I had confidence Dr. Weigel could restore the use of my shoulder. The surgery went well. I've started rehab and am having great results. I'm excited to see the use of my shoulder coming back to me! Thank you| Dr. Weigel and the whole Heartland Orthopedic Specialists staff!" -- Ray S.”
Eric W. Nelson| M.D.,“"I was having carpal tunnel issues. Dr. Nelson took great care of me through the entire process. He fixed me up and I was good as new within minutes after my surgery. Three days after my surgery| I started using my hand and began to regain strength right away. I was glad I didn't have to wait forever to use my hand again.

Thomas E. Dudley| M.D.| Ph.D.,“"Heartland Orthopedic Specialists is great! I made an appointment in May with Dr. Dudley| after my knees had been hurting for the past two years after walking a mile| and after an MRI he found a medial meniscus tear in my left knee. Surgery was done the end of June| which went great| and physical therapy started. After three weeks I was back to my nightly three mile walk without any pain| and almost six weeks later I was back to my 10 mile nightly bike ride| after my walk. So great to peddle a bike again| without pain in my knee. I would refer Heartland Orthopedic Specialists to anyone who asks| and have been telling people that if they have problems| make an appointment. Everyone is great there| from the front desk| to the nurses| to the doctors. They are all so friendly and they really care about you. I hope I never have to use them again| but if I do| that's where I'm going. Thank you all for the awesome care you gave me!!!" -- Shirley D.”
Russell S. Sticha| D.P.M.,“"I made an appointment to find out about pain I was experiencing in my ankle. I thought perhaps it was coming from the bunion that had been changing over several years. I had heard good things about Dr. Sticha| but had never met him. What I liked the best about him was that he was straight-forward| told me what the problem was| and that it might help to have sole supports in my shoes. He wrote up the prescription for them and I was done. No mess| no fuss. That's the way I like it!!!! Thank you and I would definitely return if I have any other orthopedic issues." -- Diane A.”

From the receptionist to the physical therapists to Dr. Dudley| I felt safe| cared for| and always in good hands while in their care. I was told to expect a four to six month recovery| but was back to my very physical job as a sanitation worker in only three months. Thanks to Dianne and Meagan for being ever so tough| but ever so diligent to get the most out of me. With their hard work| my wife's advice on nutrition and supplements| and a determination not to let this injury hold me back I am 100% recovered." -- David O.”

It was ALOT more major than I had expected| recovery time longer| but in the end I feel blessed to have competent professional staff through my whole experience." -- Sally B.”

Dennis P. Weigel| M.D.,“"I would like to thank Dr. Dennis Weigel for the good job that he did is fixing my left shoulder and clavical. If he hadn't done such a good job I wouldn't be able to use my left arm anymore. I had started to fall and not thinking I grabbed the railing to keep from falling. It didn't hurt until the next day and then it was on a Saturday and so I waited until on Monday to call my doctor and he had an X-ray taken and told me that I had arthritis in the shoulder| so he gave me a prescription filled. This went on for over a month. I went back to the doctor and told him that I wanted to see a specialist. So he got me an appointment with Dr. Weigel. He gave me a shot in the shoulder and said to try that. Well I called him in a week and I got another appointment with him| and he suggested surgery. I said yes| so he got an appointment set for the surgery and if it wasn't for the surgery I wouldn't be able to use my arm. I want to thank Dr. Dennis Weigel for the good job and the good care that I got at Heartland Orthopedic Specialists. The personnel there at Heartland are all very concerned about the patients and they give 100%." -- Carrie V.”
